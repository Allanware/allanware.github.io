      <description>Suite for Strings, Symphony in D major, Piano Concerto No. 5</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="concert-overview">Concert Overview</h1>
<p><a href="https://wcoconcerts.org/events/masterworks-4-john-oconor">April 22nd, 7:30 pm at Capitol Theater</a></p>
<h2 id="the-program">The program:</h2>
<ol>
<li>JANÁČEK | Suite for Strings</li>
<li>CHERUBINI | Symphony in D major [intermission]</li>
<li>BEETHOVEN | Piano Concerto No. 5, Emperor</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="suite-for-strings">Suite for Strings</h1>
<p>Leoš Janáček, along with Dvořák and Bedřich Smetana we&rsquo;ve covered in class, is considered one of the best Czech composers. He is a diligent worker, although he did not become famous until he was fiftyish. By the time he was in his 70s, he was well-sought after and someone asked him if he had any unshown work, he searched through his archives and took out this work which he composed fifty years ago at the age of 24. At that time, a composer was considered a serious one only if he/she had composed a suite for strings, so he did, although the piece went rather unnoticed.</p>
<p>Because of the wide range of moods it tries to depict, this piece has a relatively equal share of play for each part of the strings. For example, in movement V, the cello steals the spotlight and performs an extremely calm, sad, and legato melody. The mood change is also suggested by the tempo of each movement: besides the first (Moderato) and the last movement (Andante), the tempo goes from Adagio to Andante, and finally peaks at Presto, then it recedes to Adagio, where the solo cello plays. The Presto movement is like the lively 3rd movement of Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s 6th Symphony, whereas the Adagio movement is a sharp contrast in terms of tempo and mood that is comparable to the 4th movement of the 6th Symphony. Moreover, this piece has more symmetry in addition to the symmetric tempo. The melody played in the first movement, the intro, is &ldquo;recapped&rdquo; in the last movement as if Janáček wants to close the loop.</p>
<p>My favorite movement is the last movement. It sounds like the orchestra is recovered from the sadness of the 5th movement. There is one section where it sounds like the dialogue between the lower strings and the upper strings: the lower strings first pose a daunting question (a four-note downward tune), the upper strings respond by repeating the question with a lower dynamic (imitating) as if the person being asked is unsure and unconfident. Then the upper strings press on and repeat asking the same question again while raising the volume, but this time the upper strings vary the question a bit and continue playing without the interruption of the lower strings.</p>
<h1 id="symphony-in-d-major">Symphony in D Major</h1>
<p>Although his works besides opera are not among the most-played repertoire now, Luigi Cherubini was regarded by Beethoven as the greatest of his contemporaries (not sure if Beethoven included himself). In particular, this work is one of the few existed orchestra works between Mozart and Haydn and the array of romantic composers starting from Felix Mendelssohn, besides the Beethoven repertoire. Therefore, he could be seen as a transitional figure between the classical era and the romantic era. While he was in charge of the Conservatoire de Paris, Cherubini mentored Rossini, who really admired his opera work, Chopin, and Berlioz who described Cherubini as a crotchety pedant after refusing to leave when he crossed the &ldquo;female&rdquo; door without knowing he shouldn&rsquo;t be because of the rule made by Cherubini and then being chased by Cherubini and his assistants around the library&rsquo;s tables.</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that Cherubini is the type of person portrayed by Berlioz and by Adolphe Adam who wrote &ldquo;some maintain his temper was very even, because he was always angry.&rdquo; On the contrary, this symphony is really elegant, lighthearted, and beautiful: it mainly uses strings and woodwinds, and only rarely some timpani can be heard. It is in sharp contrast to Beethoven&rsquo;s symphonies. When Cherubini was commissioned in 1815 to compose this work, the first 8 symphonies of Beethoven had been published and must be known to him, but he chose not to rely on brass and percussion to maintain the lightness. Since Cherubini only uses strings and woodwinds in this work, he often engages the two parts in conversations and imitations to have a sense of playfulness. A prominent example could be seen in the 3rd movement, a Minuet, where a string melody is answered by a light one-note played by the flute. I highly doubt that there is any &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; element in this work that makes people ponder rather than slightly raises the corners of people&rsquo;s mouths. The first and the 3rd movement are maybe the most relaxed movements I have heard, something for people at that time to consider after listening to Beethoven&rsquo;s 5th Symphony.</p>
<h1 id="piano-concerto-no-5-the-emperor">Piano Concerto No. 5, the Emperor</h1>
<p>Speaking of Beethoven, here he is, the emperor. He is arguably the emperor of classical music, maybe of music in general, although he hates the notion of &ldquo;emperor&rdquo;, which is a misnomer of this piano concerto, which was dedicated to his patron Archduke Rudolf. However, he was by no means the emperor of his life around the time he composed this concerto, or most of the time in his life, when Vienna, his city, was under siege by Napoleon&rsquo;s armies and Rudolf left him in a cellar.</p>
<p>However, &ldquo;the Emperor&rdquo; was composed during Beethoven&rsquo;s heroic period, and the opening three sonorous chords played by the tutti seem to confirm the sublimeness, leading to an unusually early cadenza. The strings and percussions continue the expression of affirmative and heroic emotions in the orchestra&rsquo;s exposition and mostly throughout the first movement. But, as if he wanted to demonstrate the environment around him, as he put it &ldquo;nothing but drums, cannons, men, misery of all sorts&rdquo;, and to express his desire for inner peace, we also can hear some soft, serene melodies played by woodwinds and the soloist. The contrast in emotions is powerful, and more importantly, the transition between heroic and serene is super smooth: he uses woodwinds as the bridge between the affirmative strings and the piano, then the piano takes the woodwinds&rsquo; turn and plays some affirmative chords with higher dynamic, after that it decrescendos and finally transitions to one of the softest and the most beautiful melodies I&rsquo;ve heard. The woodwinds or the horns then pick up the soloist by accompanying his remaining chords and send us back to the heroic theme played by the strings. Therefore, the soloist has to show contrasting emotions with a convincing transition.</p>
<p>The second movement has a more consistent mood, as the piano and the tutti are either played together or extending the expressions just played by the other. I feel like some melodies in this movement have appeared in many war movies at the part when the war is over and people come back to their destructed home. If the directors of those films are understanding the movement &ldquo;correctly&rdquo;, then the subsequent 3rd movement (like Beethoven&rsquo;s 5th Symphony, the last movement begins without pause) is for sure a lively and happily welcoming-back party for Rudolf. In addition to the relatively shorter time of the last two movements compared to the 20ish minutes of the first movement, another reason for Beethoven to coalesce the two movements is to maybe offer a contrast in mood. As John O’Conor, the soloist, said: &ldquo;There are few people who know that Beethoven has a sense of humor. In the 2nd movement, he despairs in the cellar, and soon he portrays peasants dancing as if they are busy preparing for Rudolf&rsquo;s return. &quot;</p>

      <description>Isle of the Dead, Suite from the opera Háry János, Concerto in D Major for Violin and Orchestra, Op. 61</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="concert-overview">Concert Overview</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.allsenmusic.com/NOTES/2122/6.Mar22.html">March 13th, 2:30 pm at Overture Center</a></p>
<p>The concert&rsquo;s program consists of three pieces: it starts with Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s <em>Isle of the Dead</em>, then it continues with Kodály&rsquo;s <em>Suite from the opera Háry János</em>, and it ends with Ludwig Beethoven&rsquo;s violin concerto <em>Concerto in D Major for Violin and Orchestra, Op. 61</em> after the intermission.</p>
<h2 id="isle-of-the-dead">Isle of the Dead</h2>
<p>If Beethoven&rsquo;s concerto is the main course that features the highly anticipated performance from the violin virtuoso Gil Shaham, then Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s symphonic poem <em>Isle of the Dead</em> is the direct opposite to the relaxing apéritif that should bring us a trifle tipsiness. Instead, it is solemn, sober, and requires the audience&rsquo;s full energy to feel the approach of death and then decide to fight or accept it. The opening 5/8 asymmetrical meter portrays Charon(boatman of the underworld) rowing the boat on the Styx River with thick and oily water towards the island of the dead &ndash; this piece is inspired by Böcklin&rsquo;s painting &ldquo;Isle of the Dead&rdquo; which portrays the same event. The 2 strokes on the left and 3 on the right (later the reverse) are gentle, rhythmic, and hypnotic, intending to soothe the passenger and bringing the near-dead to sleep. Also, Rachmaninoff used this unusual meter to incorporate some Russian elements into this piece, as Russian folk songs often use the 5 meter instead of the more &ldquo;regular&rdquo; ones. As the boat is going forward, the seemingly incessant rowing tune represented by lower strings and brass disappears and is replaced by the gentle slow upper string and woodwind sound [5:27], as if the soul is awakened now as the boat is approaching the island. This passage expresses the reluctance to part with life; [7:07] as the boat keeps moving the emotion is evolved into uneasiness as if the soul now can see the brink of the island. Just as to confirm that, the rowing tune starts again since there is no stop for Charon  [8:56]. The rowing tune builds up tension as if the boat is pulling onto the shore and the brass instruments increase their dynamics that result in the climax, the signal of the boat crashing onto the docking area [9:55]. The first section concludes when the brass recedes and the sound of the gentle yet weak soul represented by strings and woodwinds appears and gradually disappears.</p>
<p>The middle section starts with dour brass [11:11], indicating the &ldquo;welcoming&rdquo; message from the island. Then it transitions to an extremely beautiful melody played by the strings [11:40]. This passage portrays the longing for the dead from the alive. In one version of the painting, the version that inspired this piece, Böcklin was commissioned by Marie Berna to add the female figure and the coffin to the painting, to express Marie&rsquo;s longing for her dead husband. I think Rachmaninoff fuses this longing into this fragment of the piece. However, they are not allowed a lengthy farewell (Charon is busy). The upper string melody is later joined by bass string and brass, and the tempo keeps increasing (tension!), and finally is consumed by brass and three clashes of cymbals [14:42]. The near-dead is now taken away. From [15:06] to [15:51], the repeated &ldquo;long-short-short-short-long&rdquo; rhythmic pattern is played by brass, increasing in pitch and dynamic, and imitated by upper strings, as if the personnel (played by brass) at the island is &ldquo;accompanying&rdquo; the dead (played by upper strings) to climb up the stairs, and as they go higher and higher, the pitch and dynamic become higher and higher. [15:52]The tension continues to build as the upper strings change to a different 4-note melody that sounds like screaming as if the near-dead realizes what is imminent when he looks down the hill. He/she wants to break free from the &ldquo;accompanying&rdquo; personnel, but it is impossible as the string melody is tightly gripped by the accompanying brass and yet again conquered, vanquished, consumed by the brass and cymbals [16:17]. The brass triumphs, and laughs rather evilly (represented by the 4 notes) [16:30].</p>
<p>Finally, the near-dead achieves death when the final section begins with <em>Dies Irae</em> [16:37]. The 4-note melody is repeated again and again in woodwinds just like the death is hypnotizing the dead. [17:18]Suddenly, the fast-paced 4-note <em>Dies Irae</em> played by the shiveringly tremoloed string is fast approaching to give the dead the final blow, and then it resolves to a peaceful woodwind melody to relieve the struggle of the dead. After a brief orchestral mourning of the dead, the 5/8 rowing tune reappears [19:10] &ndash; Charon is setting out for another duty, another business in his perspective. The appearance and the return of the tune embody the cycle of the leave and return to the island.</p>
<p>Charon is the action (he rows people to death) and the concept/subject itself. The requirement of becoming a concept is objectivity. For example, &ldquo;love&rdquo; in &ldquo;Alice loves Bob&rdquo; is not a concept but an action, but &ldquo;love&rdquo; without Alice and Bob is a concept. His objectivity, emotionlessness, and fairness make him the perfect symbol of death. Maybe in his early career, he wants to know, but over time, he has become the concept itself, senseless and careless of who is on the boat. To do that, he has to immerse himself into the cycle and repeat it many times so that he could forget which iteration of the cycle he is currently in (to get a feeling of what it likes or what takes to be Charon, you could play the Isle of the Island in loop).</p>
<h3 id="note-and-some-final-thoughts">Note and some final thoughts</h3>
<p>Like many pieces composed during the Romantic period, <em>Isle of the Dead</em> is program music. Moreover, it is a symphonic poem that uses a single continuous movement to illustrate an idea. The narrative is not as explicit as that of Kodály&rsquo;s <em>Suite from the opera Háry János</em>, but it can be to some extent deduced, interpreted, and reconstructed, under the title of this piece and Böcklin&rsquo;s painting. This piece tries to explore the ultimate unknown of the human being, namely, the passage between life and death. My attempt at understanding this piece starts with the <em>emotion</em> evoked by the melody, variation, repetition, or progressions of the tone colors, dynamics, pace, and pitch, then tries to fill in the imagined <em>narrative</em> that evokes the same emotion. Therefore, it is an attempt of me to construct a mapping from the orchestral effort to the narrative (just as if it is narrated in a poem).</p>
<p>The timeline is constructed under a recording from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VtNWf-kAJM&amp;ab_channel=olla-vogala">Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. 
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>
</p>
<p>Therefore, the exact timestamps vary by different recordings. Also, like there exist different versions of recordings, interpretation of the piece varies. Similarly, this piece is Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s interpretation of Böcklin&rsquo;s painting. Although this piece was inspired by the painting, it is self-contained and it represents his understanding of the subject, death. Equivalently, this piece inspired me to ponder over this subject. Moreover, just as Rachmaninoff was &ldquo;haunted&rdquo; by death &ndash; he composed several pieces that contain the &ldquo;Dies Irae&rdquo; chant over the years, I am sure my interpretation will change as I relisten to this piece in the future. This neverending and eternal momentum that inspires changes is one of the best qualities of the best arts, which makes it timeless.</p>
<h2 id="suite-from-the-opera-háry-jános">Suite from the opera Háry János</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, it is the orchestra version of the opera Háry János, so it is a highly &ldquo;programmed&rdquo; set of pieces that follow closely with the plot and the emotion of the characters. The story is of an Austrian peasant and veteran who sits in the village inn telling fantastic tales of him winning the heart of Marie Louise, the wife of Napoleon, and singlehandedly defeating Napolean and his armies.</p>
<p>I would imagine that anyone who has watched the opera or know the story could understand and fill in the plot while listening to this suite. For example, in the fourth movement, the story goes that Napoleon orders the troops to attack, but eventually kneels down and begs for mercy and his wife&rsquo;s heart. All these can be heard through the solo saxophone that personifies Napoleon. The soloist sat through the first 3 movements (with the mask on), but in the 4th movement, he started playing a melancholy tune, signaling Napolean&rsquo;s remorse over the loss of his wife&rsquo;s heart to the antagonist. Another very Hungarian and narrative-related sound is called an orchestral &ldquo;musical sneeze&rdquo;, which starts the suite off, as best explained in Kodály&rsquo;s own words: &ldquo;According to Hungarian superstition, if a statement is followed by a sneeze of one of the hearers, it is regarded as confirmation of its truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This suite also makes use of one of the Hungarian&rsquo;s traditional instruments, the cimbalom, which uses a pair of hammers to strike the strings to make sounds. The tone color is very unique. In the 3rd movement, the tones played by the cimbalom remind me of Guzheng, a Chinese plucked string instrument. In the intermezzo movement, my favorite movement, which is light and mellow since it is the intermission between the victory over Napolean and the final commendation by the emperor in his palace, its tone color is close to a harpsichord. I am amazed that in Madison Symphony Orchestra they have that instrument and have someone who knows how to play it.</p>
<p>We know that Háry János is a bragger, but somehow we do not feel like laughing at him but sympathizing with him. It again can be best summed up in Kodály&rsquo;s own words: &ldquo;Every Hungarian is a dreamer. He flees from the sad reality of the centuries&hellip;into the world of illusions. Yet Háry János&rsquo;s boasting is more than a dream: it is also poetry. The authors of heroic tales are themselves no heroes, but they are the spiritual kin of heroes. Háry János may never have done the deeds he talks about, but the potential is always there. János is a primitive poet, and what he has to say he concentrates on a single hero: himself. After we have listened to the heroic feats he has dreamed up, it is tragically symbolic that we see him in a grubby village inn. He appears happy in his poverty: a king in the kingdom of his dreams.&rdquo; We can hear the underlying melancholy in the intermezzo, to some degree disguised by the happiness, because we know it is not true happiness and the music wants to covertly show us that as well. Another more explicit representation of the sadness is in the 3rd movement, the &ldquo;Song&rdquo;, a slow, melancholy movement that is about Háry and his fiancée Orsze&rsquo;s longing for home and their wish for a little cottage when they return. We no longer know whether this is still bragging or reality.</p>
<h2 id="concerto-in-d-major-for-violin-and-orchestra-op-61">Concerto in D Major for Violin and Orchestra, Op. 61</h2>
<p>Contrary to the pieces played before the intermission, the &ldquo;main course&rdquo; is not program music, so there exist infinitely many possibilities. For now, it still requires more listening to come up with my analysis. I&rsquo;ve heard one soloist say that while playing this concerto he feels like he is a little bird crossing the vast sea that is portrayed by the orchestra. This interpretation indeed reveals one characteristic of this piece &ndash; the equality and the balance between the soloist and the remaining orchestra, which is shown for example in the first part of the first movement, where the orchestra plays the main melody and the soloist sometimes accompanies the orchestra the other time plays his notes in juxtaposition to the main melody. This balance was uncommon in Beethoven&rsquo;s time when audiences and soloists expected to see/hear and play some flamboyant showmanship. It is not surprising that Franz Clement, to whom this piece was dedicated, did not prepare at all for the premier, inserted his sonatas while playing, and onetime during the play held the violin upside-down, and the reviews were not favorable. I am not sure how this act related to the subsequent facts such as Beethoven only composed one violin concerto (another &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; set forth by Beethoven followed by Tchaikovsky and Brahms, etc.) and he later explicitly wrote out notes for cadenzas in concertos (e.g. Beethoven&rsquo;s 5th piano concerto).</p>
<p>But this is not to say that the virtuosity of the soloist is not manifested at all. Although I am not familiar with the violin techniques and therefore cannot assess the difficulty of playing solo, there are a lot of high trills but none of them played by Gil Shaman, the soloist, is harsh. His smiles when he was not playing convey the utter happiness of the &ldquo;bird&rdquo;.</p>

      <description>I will discuss internet censoring techniques, what types of information are censored specifically in China, and ethical concerns regarding internet censorship in China.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Internet, the network of networks, has long been regarded as the borderless utopian world where people across the world can communicate and share anything they want. This vision is reinforced by the continual growth of the internet powered by advances in both hardware and software. However, as the report shows, the future of the global network may be shaped by regional differences [1]. One notable difference is how different governments censor online information. In this report, I will discuss internet censoring techniques, what types of information are censored specifically in China, and ethical concerns regarding internet censorship in China.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="online_censorship.png" alt="online-censorship"  />
</p>
<p><em><em>Internet censorship 2020: [2]</em></em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Censorship is where an entity in a position of power - such as a government, organization, or individual - suppresses communication that it considers objectionable, harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect, or inconvenient [3]. If someone is censored, she could be suppressed in either accessing or publishing certain information or both. In the context of the internet, censorship is composed of three elements [4]: prescription, identification, and interference. In the section below that discusses internet censorship techniques, I will list more details on how those elements are implemented.</p>
<p>The Great Firewall of China, the internet version of the Great Wall that censors both domestic and international internet traffic, is extremely controversial. Ever since China was connected to the Internet, the Chinese government realized its potential and attempted to control the internet [5]. Over the years, we have seen events that scream censorship led by the government: Google’s eventual retreat after years of attempts to reach a mutual agreement with the government regarding censorship [6], the block of YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, etc. [7], the internet shutdown during the Uyghur protest [8], and many others. In a later section, I will discuss the patterns behind censorship and the related ethical issues in more detail.</p>

<p>The three elements, prescription, identification, and interference, serve as a three-step process to accomplish the censorship goal. Censors determine what to censor during the prescription stage. Identification is the process to identify traffics to be censored based on the prescribed results. Finally, censors implement ways to block or impair access to those identified connections and traffics.</p>
<p>The prescription process can be either static or dynamic or both [9]. The static approach uses a blocklist to maintain a list of elements to be blocked. There are three types of blocklist elements [4]: keyword, domain name, and IP address. The prescription may happen in real-time as well. During traffic bursts, the censors may use web crawling, machine learning, or even massive human labor to evaluate real-time contents and decide if they should be censored [10].</p>
<p>The last two steps, identification and interference, can happen at all levels of the network hierarchy where the internet traffics is transmitted. I will call points controlled by the censors in the network hierarchy as points of control, which include but are not limited to: the Internet backbone [11], internet service providers, content distribution networks, and service providers (e.g., search engines, video hosting services, online forums, etc.). After identifying the points of control, the censors can install identification and interference hardware to perform the last two steps.</p>
<p>Censors can identify prescribed elements in either the application layer or the transportation layer or both (they often use both to get more accurate results). <strong>At the application layer</strong>, the most straightforward way to identify blocklist elements is by looking at the HTTP request/response header. The header contains a list of useful information such as the domain name of the requested service under the “host” field. In this way, the censors can block or impair traffics with the hosts in the blocklist [12]. Another related method is URL filtering. A more expensive and intrusive way for identification is called Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). DPI reassembles network flows to examine the application &ldquo;data&rdquo; section, as opposed to only headers, and is therefore often used for identifying prescribed keywords [13]. DPI is also used in blocking Tor in China [14]. <strong>At the transport layer</strong>, the transport header contains the source IP address and destination IP address that can be used to identify the prescribed IPs. The port number along with properties of payload data and flow behavior can be used to identify the protocol used [15], to detect and block traffics generated using circumvention tools. China uses this protocol identification to block Tor [12]. Furthermore, internal identification where content providers identify keywords within their services can be also deployed. A commonly used method of instrumenting content distributors/providers consists of keyword identification to detect restricted terms on their platform. The distributors are willing to comply either due to pressure from the government or incentives from the government or both.</p>
<p>After prescribing and identifying elements, the next step is to interfere with those elements by blocking or impairing them. <strong>At the application layer</strong>, the most commonplace point censors use to interfere is at Domain Name System (DNS). When users enter a domain name to access the website, the browser iteratively asks DNS servers about the IP address associated with the domain to request contents from the website. If the domain name is in the blocklist, determined in the prescription and identification phase, the censor will interfere with the translation process (from domain name to IP address). There are many ways that censors can use to block access to content by altering responses from the DNS, including blocking the response, replying with an error message, or responding with an incorrect address [4][16]. The most prominent technique is DNS cache poisoning. To increase the “translation” performance, DNS servers usually cache the translations for future uses. However, if the DNS servers controlled by the censor respond more quickly than the authoritative DNS resolver with a fake IP address, then the fake address will be cached in all downstream DNS resolvers, which will affect all computers that use those resolvers. <strong>At the transport layer</strong>, packet dropping is a simple way to block any connection with certain prescribed elements. For example, China once dropped all packets to GitHub (the destination IP belongs to GitHub) [17]. If the connection has already been established, the censor can inject RST packets to both sides of the connection that signify the session has been terminated.</p>
<p>Other interfering techniques include Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), network shutdown, manual filtering, self-censorship, and server takedown [4]. The DDoS attack uses botnet or other distributed platforms to flood the services to be blocked by sending enormous traffic to the website so that legitimate requests are ignored. The “Great Cannon”, part of the Great Firewall of China, once redirected web visits to attack certain services [18]. The network shutdown and server takedown, as the names suggested, shut down certain services or all services. China shut down the network in the Xinjiang region during unrest in 2009 in an effort to prevent the protests from spreading to other regions [19]. To avoid being held liable by the government, companies are pressured or incentivized to apply self-censorship. Weibo and Google before its retreat agreed to conform to be &ldquo;self-disciplined&rdquo; in order to get the business license to operate in China [20]. Self-discipline involves taking down content that has certain keywords. Manual filtering is more accurate in marking or removing content with certain keywords than automatic filtering using machine learning. China’s army of monitors employs a lot of human laborers to censor the contents [10].</p>
<h2 id="implications-of-the-censorship-in-china">Implications of the censorship in China</h2>
<p>Technologies have implications when they are deployed in the real world. All of the techniques described above can be used to censor child porn, pirate music, or political content. Why the internet censorship is particularly controversial in China, when other countries censor online content to some extent as well? To figure out that question, we need to know what contents are blocked or impaired in China.</p>
<p>According to [10], there are three types of censorship regarding human expression in China: entire websites in [7] such as Facebook, and YouTube; keyword blocking; hand/manual censoring. The first two censorship techniques can be evaded if you really want to express yourself. China has close alternatives to banned websites such as Weibo (vs Twitter), Baidu (vs Google), and WeChat (vs Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram), and people can express themselves on those platforms. The keyword blocking can be evaded easily since netizens in China can outwit automated keyword binding programs by coming up with clever phasing due to the characteristics of the Chinese language. However, none of the evading techniques could pass the third technique, manual censoring. Since the third technique is the most expensive, extensive, and the strictest technique and the first two have little effect on suppressing human expression, [10] argues that measuring what the manual censoring tries to block gives us an idea of what the Chinese government tries to censor. After comparing the contents of censored posts and non-censored posts, [10] concludes that posts with collective potential, porn, and criticisms of the censors are heavily censored. Posts with collective potential refer to posts posted by someone other than the government and have the potential to join people together to express themselves collectively or even generate collective actions such as protests. On the contrary, posts about government policies, and verbal attacks on government and government officials are much less censored, unless they are attacks on censorship itself. For example, posts about people rushing to buy salt after the earthquake and posts about supporting the government’s actions in the Philippine-China island dispute are censored and blocked as they are considered to have collective potential, despite they are innocuous and pro-government. On the other hand, posts about local corruption that do not have collective potential are not censored by the central government (might be censored by the local governments) and might be even encouraged since the central government wants to know the truth and better control the local governments and maintain its stability. [5] uses the word &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo; to refer to the same idea of the collective potential.</p>
<p>In summary, posts/contents that have collective potential or encourage solidarity without the intention of the central government are censored and likely to be blocked, along with porn and criticisms of the censorship. Additionally, foreign services that do not comply with the censorship agreement, keywords that are deemed “harmful” by the government [21], and posts that are blocked by stricter censorships rules made by content providers to avoid liability (government might allow certain posts but companies just ban them outright) are also censored. Now that we have some ideas on what contents will be censored, what are the ethical issues with such decisions that censor those types of information mentioned above?</p>
<h2 id="ethical-arguments">Ethical arguments</h2>
<h3 id="freedom-of-speech">Freedom of speech</h3>
<p>The central ethical issue of censorship is whether it violates freedom of speech. If we interpret freedom of speech to its “extreme” form, namely, everyone shall have the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, through any media of his choice [22], then any kind of censorship violates this right. In reality, it is used with Mill’s harm principle: the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others [23]. In other words, people can seek and express whatever they want only if it does not produce harm to others. As a matter of fact, the constitution of China closely follows Mill’s harm principle. According to Article 35 of the Constitution of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, citizens of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China enjoy the freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession, and of demonstration [24]; according to Article 51, when the citizens of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China exercises freedom and rights, they must not harm the interest of the state, society, people and other citizen’s freedom and rights [27].</p>
<p>If we believe in freedom of speech as a human right using Mill’s harm principle, then the morality of censorship in the case of porn, collective potential, and criticism of censorship is dependent on whether those three things produce harm. If they do not produce any harm, then censoring them is immoral.</p>
<p>Does, the first category of censorship in China, porn produce harm? It is worth noting that porn here refers to producing, disseminating, or selling porn, not watching porn privately. The censoring of child porn in Australia and many other countries can be justified using Mill’s harm principle if we think harm is produced because child porn involves actual sexual abuse or exploitation of children [25]. But can we justify the claim that extends the censorship to the block of all porn on the internet (if porn is put on the internet, it is considered disseminating/selling porn)? To do that, we have to extend the notion of harm beyond explicit harm as there is no explicit harm involved in the production/dissemination/selling of non-child porn:</p>
<ol>
<li>If X is intrinsically morally wrong [25], then X produces harm.</li>
<li>Porn is intrinsically morally wrong.</li>
<li>Porn produces harm (1,2)</li>
<li>If porn produces harm, then it is morally permissible to censor porn.</li>
<li>Censoring porn is morally permissible (3, 4).</li>
</ol>
<p>The 2nd assumption follows because the Chinese government regards porn as &ldquo;spiritual pollution&rdquo; [26] and if anything pollutes the mind or spirit, it can be seen as intrinsically wrong.</p>
<p>The same framework can be applied to the second and third categories of censorship in China: collective potential and criticisms of censorship itself. To simplify things a bit, I would regard the criticisms of censorship as one type of collective potential since it has the potential to gather public expressions such as collective disapproval. To justify the censorship of collective potential, harm must be shown. Does collective potential have explicit harm? Collective actions can be either a peaceful demonstration or protest that is legal under Article 35, or protests that explicitly harm others. Since collective potential only has the potential to be either one of them, it currently does not have explicit harm. Collective potential also cannot be determined to be intrinsically morally wrong due to the same reason. Therefore, an argument against the morality of censoring collective potential can be formed:</p>
<ol>
<li>If collective potential does not produce harm, then censorship of collective potential is morally impermissible as it violated freedom of speech.</li>
<li>Collective potential does not produce harm.</li>
<li>It is not morally permissible to censor collective potential (1,2).</li>
</ol>
<p>If we really want to justify the morality of censoring collective potential, we have to extend the notion of harm one step further: actions that are “very likely” to produce harm are considered harmful in themselves. For example, posts about people rushing to buy salt after an earthquake may very likely lead to collective actions that result in people who are in dire need of salt cannot buy salt, so it is harmful under the newly extended notion of harm. Therefore, it is morally permissible to take down such posts as we are “almost 100% sure” that they will harm others. A problem with such an extension on the definition of harm is that it is naturally under arbitration and ambiguity. The notion of “very likely” is extremely open to interpretation. This ambiguity is exacerbated by the fact that most censorship occurs at the company level under the category of self-censorship. Because there exists little clear guideline on what to censor, companies have to do guesswork themselves. When Google was questioned by the U.S. Congress on whether they have confirmed with the Chinese government on what to censor before actually censoring those contents, Google said they were just following what others did (local companies, Yahoo!, etc.) [5]. Essentially, it was not the government that was censoring, it was Google that made the decisions. Furthermore, the users will do self-censorship before they express themselves if they fear their speech would be considered “very likely” to produce harm. Therefore, the argument against considering “very likely” to cause harm as harm can be formed:</p>
<ol>
<li>If everyone in the world has to perform self-censorship and others might censor your expression based on arbitrary criteria, then the freedom of speech is violated.</li>
<li>It is the case that everyone has to self-censor and the censorship criteria are arbitrary since we do not have standard censorship rules.</li>
<li>The freedom of speech is violated (1,2).</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, we have to reject the arbitration in determining the harm of some actions. As a result, it is not morally permissible to censor collective potential.</p>
<h3 id="internet-access-as-a-human-right">Internet access as a human right</h3>
<p>It is not entirely true that foreign services such as Google, YouTube, and Wikipedia are blocked altogether. Circumvention tools such as Virtual Private Network (VPN) still exist and are functional, although VPN service providers are often engaged in the “cat and mouse” game with the government as using VPN is not illegal while providing VPN to the public is illegal. As a result, elites with the knowledge and money to use VPN, elite universities, foreigners, and foreign companies do have the access to the “whole” internet, although with some costs and some hassles such as the need to change VPN providers from time to time. On the other hand, people without such capabilities do not have access to part of the services on the internet. If we define internet access as access to the internet infrastructure and web services on top of that and internet access is one of the human rights, then most Chinese people’s right to access the internet is violated.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The report first discusses general techniques to perform censorship. Then it focuses on China to discuss the implications of using censorship techniques. Specifically, the report shows what the government really tries to censor and block: information with collective potential, porn, and critics of the censorship. Finally, the report discusses the ethical issues of the censorship performed in China around violation of freedom of speech and violation of internet access as a human right.</p>
<p>Since censorship in itself is not intrinsically wrong, as we have shown in discussing the censorship of child porn. However, the only way to justify censoring collective potential is to treat information that is “very likely” to cause harm as real harm, leading to the problem of arbitration and self-censorship. To resolve that, we can either stop censoring collective potential or define “very-likely” in clear, transparent, and standardized ways.</p>

      <description>What happened in the 2nd half of the 2005 Champions League final, compared to the 1st half? This post uses R to expose details that the highlights and/or the match itself ignored.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>On May 25th 2005, the 2005 UEFA Champions league final took place at the
Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. 65000 audiences at the stadium and
hundreds of millions of fans worldwide were about to witness a soccer
game that would be later called the <strong>Miracle of Istanbul</strong>. The
full-of-talent team AC Milan first took the lead within the first minute
by their captain Maldini. They further scored two more goals before
half-time, making it a 3-0 lead. Rumors said that the Milan team opened
bottles of champagnes in the locker room during the half-time break to
celebrate their soon-to-be 2nd champions league title in three years.
However, in the second half Liverpool launched a comeback and scored 3
goals in a dramatic six-minute spell to level the score at 3–3, and beat
Milan 3-2 in the brutal penalty shoot-out stage. The English commentator
said:“If this doesn’t prove fate exists, then nothing will” at the end
of the game. To be sure, this epic comeback defies any words that try to
describe it, but I will try to use visualizations to do this job and
more importantly, try to figure out how the comeback happened.</p>
<h3 id="the-underdog">The underdog</h3>
<p>The Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard described his team as the underdog
before the match, compared to the all-star Milan side, and he was right.

we can see that the market value of Milan’s starting XI is significantly
higher than Liverpool’s. Individually, Milan’s players took 8 places out
of the top 10 highest market value players of the joint teams. The
captain Steven Gerrard and the striker Baros are the 2 exceptions for
Liverpool.</p>
<p>After setting the stage, let us go to the actual match.</p>
<h2 id="the-data">The Data</h2>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The dataset comes from the open-source github repository of the soccer
data analytic company <em>statsbomb</em>. They make public 878 datasets in JSON
format, one per game, including this one. Every dataset contains
thousands of events, each event is characterized by about 100 or more
variables that describe the event.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">dim</span>(istanbul)
</span></span></code></pre></div><pre><code>## [1] 4648  126
</code></pre>
<p>The dataset that records events about the miracle of Istanbul has 4648
events, each is described by 126 variables.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">head</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">colnames</span>(istanbul), n <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><pre><code>##  [1] &quot;id&quot;             &quot;index&quot;          &quot;period&quot;         &quot;timestamp&quot;     
##  [5] &quot;minute&quot;         &quot;second&quot;         &quot;possession&quot;     &quot;duration&quot;      
##  [9] &quot;related_events&quot; &quot;location&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The above shows the first 10 variables. The first variable <code>id</code> is the
unique identifier of each event; <code>period</code> denotes which time period this
event occurs (eg. 1 = the first half); <code>timestamp</code> records the exact
time of each event; <code>location</code> is another important variable that
records the coordinate information of the event. An example event
therefore would be: player x at time 00:31:52.716 passes the ball at the
pitch coordinate (24, 40) at mid-height with angle y…. As I go forward, we
will use and visualize more interesting variables.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics-of-the-data">Characteristics of the data</h3>
<ul>
<li>The dataset is really sparse (lots of NULL or NA values). This makes
sense, because at one time point only one player is able to make one
action. For example, Variable <code>dribble_nutmeg</code> is not NA if and only
if some player nutmugs someone else (ouch!).</li>
</ul>

</span></span></code></pre></div><pre><code>## [1] 4
</code></pre>
<p>4 nutmegs in 120 minutes (90 mins regular time plus 30 mins extra), not
bad!</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to take special care of the <code>location</code> variable. The
<code>location</code> denotes the pitch coordinates of each event. The
coordinate is standardized as dimension 120 * 80. However, soccer
pitch size varies and the Atatürk Olympic Stadium has dimension 105
meters * 68 meters. We need to scale the coordinate from the
relative location to the actual meters, so that the event will show
up on the correct location on the pitch I draw.</li>

<p>To summarize the timeline that we see above. In the first half, Milan
scored immediately when the game began, and scored two more goals
towards the end of the first half. On the other hand, Liverpool made a
substitute because of injury. Before the start of the 2nd half,
Liverpool was already 3-0 down and used one (out of total 3)
substitution involuntarily. At the beginning of the 2nd half, Liverpool
made yet another substitution. This substitution is due to the tactical
consideration by the Liverpool manager, trying to turn things around,
and it did. About 10 minutes later, Liverpool score their first goal,
making it 3-1, and in this 6 minutes spell, they score three goals in
total, levelling the score to 3-3. Both teams did not score in the later
parts of the game, and Liverpool beat Milan 3-2 in Penalty shootout (the
red X denotes penalty missing or being saved by the goalkeeper).</p>
<p>By seeing this timeline plot, all the key events are laid out clearly.
Furthermore, we can immediately gain insights towards our question,
which is, how the miracle happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>The three comeback goals were scored in 6 minutes! What happened in
those 6 minutes?</li>
<li>The distribution of goals are quite “even”, in that Milan scored 3
in the first half and Liverpool scored 3 in the second half. Why
that is the case?</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing that stands out from the timeline graph is that there were
only 2 yellow cards (all from Liverpool) and 0 red card in the game.
That is extremely rare for a soccer game, especially for the Champions
League final, the biggest game of the year. It shows how both teams were
focusing on playing the game actively, not on playing the game passively
(by fouling a lot to stop the other team’s play). It is truly a smooth
and high quality game, and dramatic.</p>
<h2 id="heaven-or-hell">Heaven or Hell</h2>
<p>As the timeline suggested, we see a distinction between the 1st half and
the 2nd half. Each team scored three goals and the other team scored
nothing. Specifically, the 1st half is the heaven for Milan, the hell
for Liverpool; the 2nd half is exactly the reverse of the 1st half. Can
we visualize the difference, the difference between heaven and hell?</p>

</p>
<p>As we can see, in the 1st half, Milan made 8 shots (8 dots on the pic
above) and Liverpool made 5. However, most of the shots by Milan (6 out
of 8) were inside the box, whereas Liverpool only had 2.</p>

In the 2nd half, we’d expect that Liverpool dominates the shots and
shots in the box. On the contrary, Milan still dominates the number of
shots and shots in the box. Liverpool made only 2 shots inside the box
and they all made it into the net, and Liverpool also scored a
long-ranger. However, Milan attempted 6 shots inside the box and 6 more
outside the box, none of them made it.</p>
<p>Let’s see the comparison between shots made by both teams in the extra
time.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img loading="lazy" src="unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" alt=""  />

Surprisingly (or not so surprisingly after seeing the shots made in the
2nd half of the game), Liverpool made no attempts and Milan made 7 more
shots, 3 of them inside the box with 1 near the post of the goal (so
close!) and yet, Milan scored nothing.</p>

<p>We break the 1st half into two halves. The <strong>picture 1</strong> shows the
passing map of AC Milan in the first 24 minutes, with Pirlo being the
center of the passing map (the biggest blue dot in the map), Milan’s
transition (from attack to defense and vice versa) depended on him.
Another thing to notice is that one of the Milan’s forward, Crespo, was
not really involved in the game. The <strong>picture 2</strong> is the passing map
of Milan in the second half of the 1st half. Compared to the first
picture, Milan’s formation retrieved to their goal. For example, in the
first 24 minutes, Maldini (left back), Gattuso, Seedorf, were standing
in front of the Pirlo; they were behind Pirlo in the later half of the
1st half. I would guess the reason was due to the increase in
aggressiveness of Liverpool, as well as their own strategy of
contracting their defensive lines and playing counterattack, since they
led 1-0 as early as 1 minute into the game. And that strategy was
fantastic! They scored two more goals on counter attack at 39’ and 44’
when Liverpool tried really hard attacking (since they were 1-0 behind).
The scorer of both goals is Crespo, the man who were not “involved” in
terms of passing in the first 24 minutes, and he became lethal in the
second part.</p>
<p>The <strong>picture 3 and 4</strong> tell the Liverpool’s part of the story
in the 1st half. The first thing to notice is that Kewell was out and
Smicer was in for him (Kewell was in the 3rd pic but not in the 4th, and
Smicer the opposite) because Kewell was injured. And compared the 4th
with the 3rd picture, Gerrard and Sanz were pushing forward and to the
center, while the two wingers Riise and Smicer were roughly in the same
position as before.</p>

<p>We have seen the hell for Liverpool, i.e., the first half of the game,
where Milan scored an early goal and player on counter and scored two
more goals while Liverpool was struggling in attacking. However, as the
timeline suggests, in the second half of the game, there was a 6-minute
spell where Liverpool scored 3 goals. That spell was really the heaven
for Liverpool and for Liverpool’s fans. What happened? Since we are in
the passing section and analyzing passes are really effective in
analyzing the whole game, let’s look at all the passes happened in that
spell. In the <strong>picture 1</strong>, Milan achieved 27 passes with less than
60% of them completed. Only 8 players of Milan were involved in passing
the ball one or more times. Looking more closely, the <strong>picture 2</strong>
indicated that the passes from defense to midfield and midfield to
attack all failed (red: failure, blue: success).</p>
<p>On the contrary, the <strong>picture 3</strong> shows that all 10 players
(excluding the goalkeeper) were involved in passing, and they achieved
more than 75% passing accuracy. The <strong>picture 4</strong> shows the exact
passes.</p>
<p>In the 1st half, the passing accuracy was 78% for Milan. What causes
this decline in passing accuracy and number of passes on the Milan side,
whereas Liverpool somehow maintained their passing accuracy? I then look
at the defensive acts by both teams in that six minutes.</p>

<p>The <strong>picture 1</strong> is the defensive actions done by Liverpool players
in 6 minutes. What is staggering is that they managed to achieve 7 ball
retrievals, leading to the decline in Milan’s passing accuracy. The
<strong>picture 2</strong> shows the defensive actions done by Milan. The mere 1
ball retrieve hardly influenced Liverpool’s passing and possession.</p>
<h3 id="position">Position</h3>
<p>We have seen some visual information about the position of the players
in the passing maps earlier, to the point that we saw some deliberate
position shifts from the Milan side in the 1st half when they contracted
their defense lines. Through the viualizations below, we can see more
about the shifts in positions in terms of the whole team (i.e. shifts in
team formation) and individual key players.</p>

<p>The <strong>picture 1</strong> is the average position of the Milan in the 1st
half. The average position is defined as the average coordinates of
players when they take any actions, not only the passing ones. As we can
see, the Milan’s formation were really tight in the center of the
midfield. In addition to the 4 midfielders, one of the forwards Crespo
was close to midfield as well. And they were close together in the
center for a reason (as explained below).</p>
<p>In the <strong>picture 2</strong>, Liverpool’s formation in the 1st half was rather
scattered acrossthe width of the field. This was due to their tactics of
playing wide on the sides. Gerrard and Olano were together as a pair,
sitting in the midfield. However, their attacks on the sides were not
going very well, so Milan decided not to put too many players on the
sides (indicated by the 1st pic) and focused their attacks and later
their counter attacks in the center.</p>

<p>With 3-0 down, Liverpool took right back Finnan down (therefore
forfeiting the attacking on the sides tactics) and put Hamman up
immediately in the beginning of the 2nd half, and the result was
astonishing! In the <strong>picture 2</strong>, Hamann took the position of where
Gerrard was in the 1st half, and freed Gerrard. By sacrificing the right
back, the Liverpool squeezed their formation towards the center.
Gerrard, together with Sanz and Baros, were constantly charging to the
Milan’s box carefree, since Hamann took care of his defensive duties.
And Boom! Gerrard scored the first goal, a header inside the box, and
created a penalty (later converted to the 3rd goal).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Some may say that there is no need to visualize a soccer match, since it
is a visual art/sport in itself. I have to agree since I am a soccer fan
and have had so much joy and pain watching the games. It is especially
hard to try to visualize a miracle. However, I did it anyway because an
EDA process on a soccer match dataset can achieve the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A visual summary. In normal games, audiences see the motions of
players in terms of motions of pictures, and they do not have good
enough memory to remember everything and do not have time to
summarize those information, as they are concentrated on the game
itself. After the match, audiences will see lots of statistics about
the game, such as the number of shots, the possession rate, number
of passes, pass accuracy, etc, and they do not make much sense and
they are not even comparable. A 65% possession rate in a game by a
side is not the same thing as another team having 65% in another
game. Go ask Barcelona fans. Their team used to have 65% possession
and ended up winning all trophies, and now win nothing with the same
possession rate. Visualizations like this can combine the visual
part with the summary part, providing fans with a more immersive and
insightful perspective towards understanding the game.</li>
<li>A good starting point for models about soccer game. As the advance
of data science, models about soccer games are in dire need. A
prominent example would be the model to predict expected goals given
the data about soccer games. This EDA process is great for:
<ol>
<li>See the data and find the characteristics of the data. In my example, it would be a lot of None values in the dataset and incompatible field dimension that I need to manually change.</li>
<li>Visualize the key events that may lead to goals.</li>
<li>Find out directions that may worth pursuing. I find out the 6 minute Liverpool spell and think this may be the direction to look further into.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Main lessons learnt: It is no doubt a miracle, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Super dramatic. Liverpool dominated the game for only 6 minutes, and
ended up scoring three goals. Milan took the show for 114 minutes,
including 7 shots in extra time, and they failed to score any after the 1st
half. The inefficiency in shooting influenced their mindset in the final
penality shoot out, missing 3 out of 5. And Dudek’s (Liverpool’s
goalkeeper) double save from Shevchenko in the 117th minute was
voted the greatest Champions League moment of all time.</li>
<li>Some reasons behind the comeback drama. 6 minutes spell because of
the introduce of Hamann that freed Gerrard to attack. Milan’s
success in the 1st half was also due to the formation factor, where
Milan was tight in the center and Liverpool scattered.</li>
<li>Human factor. The hard part to visualize. The psychological change
of the Milan side as they went from ecstasy to doubt, and to fear.
Their change in mindset when they repeatedly attack but scored
nothing. On the other side, Gerrard and his influence on the
whole team.</li>
