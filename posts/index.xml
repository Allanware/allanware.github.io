<h2 id="approach-1-double-pointers">Approach 1: Double pointers</h2>
<p>i, j points to word1 and word2. A while loop that does the traversing and  appending. To traverse two lists throughly, we check for i &lt; len(words1) <strong>or</strong> j &lt; len(words2).</p>
<p>Inside while loop, result list appends words1[i] if i &lt; len(words1) and words2[j] if j &lt; len(words2).</p>
<p>Note: in Python, strings are immutable, we used the list <code>result</code> to append letters and later joined the list with an empty string to return it as a string object. The <code>join</code> operation takes linear time equal to the length of <code>results</code> to merge <code>results</code> with empty string.</p>
<h3 id="time">Time</h3>
<p>O(m+n): m is the length of word1, n is the length of word2.</p>
<h3 id="space">Space</h3>
<p>O(n): we use a temp list <code>result</code> to store the final string.</p>
<h2 id="approach-2-one-pointer">Approach 2: One pointer</h2>
<p>To traverse two lists throughly, we could also check for i &lt; max(len(word1), len(word2)).</p>
<p>Inside while/for loop, result list appends words1[i] if i &lt; len(words1) and words2[j] if j &lt; len(words2).</p>

<h2 id="approach-1-analgous-to-math-gcd">Approach 1: Analgous to math GCD</h2>
<p>Denote len(str1) = m, len(str1) = n.</p>
<p>if m &gt; n, gcdString = gcd(str1 - str2, str2), and vice versa. str1 - str2 means deleting str2 from the start of str1. If there is any mismatch, then there is no gcd string (return &quot;&quot; as gcdString).</p>
<p>Base case: if str1 == &ldquo;&rdquo;, return str2; vice versa</p>
<h3 id="time-1">Time</h3>
<p>We need to scan the longest string of str1 and str2 once: O(max(m+n))</p>

<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>Greedy algorithm + padding the front and the end of the array. If a spot is plantable, then +2 to find the next via spot.</p>
<p>If the array is not allowed to change, we could create a new array with paddings, or we could handle the front and end very carefully.</p>
<p>We could return True early if n is already 0 (assuming each time we find a spot we decrement n by 1).</p>

<h2 id="approach-1">Approach</h2>
<ol>
<li>Python string is immutable. First convert input string to a list to enable in-place swap. After that, use <code>&quot;&quot;.join(stringList)</code> to convert the list back to string.</li>
<li>Use a dictionary to store the vowels.</li>
<li>Use double pointers, one pointing at the front, and another pointing at the back. Use a while loop to make sure they do not cross.</li>
<li>Inside the while loop: use two while loops for i and j to find vowels, and make sure they do not touch. If they haven&rsquo;t touched after the two while loops, then they must find a pair of vowels =&gt; we do the swap.</li>

<h2 id="approach-2">Approach</h2>
<ol>
<li>Similar to the above problem. Use <code>.split()</code> split a string into a list of words. The default delimiter to <code>split</code>  is any number of white spaces.</li>
<li>Use double pointers to swap.</li>

<h2 id="approach-3">Approach</h2>
<p>To solve it and not use recursion, which is of exponential complexity, we use a dynamic programming technique:</p>
<ul>
<li>use an array of size n+1 to store the partial results along computing $T_n$</li>
<li>initialize $T_0, T_1, T_2$</li>
<li>use for loop to compute $T_n$</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="approach-4">Approach</h2>
<p>For each number in the array, to get the product of everything besides it, we can divide the problem into two halves: multiply the numbers on the left and store the result, then multiply the numbers on the right.</p>
<p>The key point is to store the partial result in an variable, and update the slots in the output array with the corresponding partial result.</p>

<h1 id="283-move-zeroeshttpsleetcodecomproblemsmove-zeroes"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/">283. Move Zeroes</a></h1>
<h2 id="approach-1-1">Approach 1</h2>
<p>This problem is under the section <em>Two Pointers</em>. I approach this problem by setting the one pointer to keep track of the first 0 on the left (the first swap position), and the other pointer to the next non-zero number (use a while loop).</p>
<h2 id="approach-2-fast-and-slow-pointer">Approach 2: Fast and Slow pointer</h2>
<p>The fast pointer iterates faster than the slower one. But they should end at about the same time. So I use a for loop to iterates the fast pointer over the whole array, and only updates the slow pointer if it points to a non-zero. Like the previous approach, essentially the fast will keep track of the non-zero, the slow keeps track of the first zero. But the structure of a for loop to update the fast, and inside the loop an if to conditionally update slow is much cleaner than approach 1.</p>

<h2 id="approach-fast-and-slow-pointer">Approach: fast and slow pointer</h2>
<p>To check if s is a substring of t, the fast pointer iterates over t, and the slow pointer iterates over s. If the iterator of s points to beyond the end of s, then we know s is a substring of t. We also use a similair structure to the above problem: a for loop for t; inside for loop, use a if to iterate s if we find a characet match.</p>

<h2 id="approach-sliding-window">Approach: Sliding window</h2>
<p>If we were to average every window, the complexity is $O(k*n)$. To make it linearly dependent on n, we observe that for each window, we only need to keep track of the changes between each window: subtract the left, add the right. My first thought was if we can find an i such that <code>nums[i] &lt; nums[i+k]</code>, then we update <code>maxI</code> to this new <code>i</code>. However, this only work locally, namely, if we compare two contiguous windows. It doesn&rsquo;t word between two non-neighbors since they do not share the middle two elements. Thus, we also need to track the <code>sum</code> and <code>maxSum</code>.</p>

<h2 id="approach-sliding-window-1">Approach: Sliding window</h2>
<p>Use <code>leftSum</code> and <code>rightSum</code> to store the sum of left and right elements of the potential pivot. If <code>leftSum == rightSum</code>, we find the pivot.</p>
<p>We use the sliding window approach to update <code>leftSum</code> and <code>rightSum</code>. Init <code>leftSum</code> to 0 and <code>rightSum</code> to <code>sum(nums)-nums[0]</code> for <code>i=0</code> .</p>

<h2 id="approach-5">Approach</h2>
<p>Create a dictionary; Loop through the array, and insert the element into the dictionary or increment the counter for the existing key; If the size of the dictionary (number of keys) is the same as the unique values of the counters of those keys, then we know each key (each unique element in array) has a unique number of appearances.</p>

<h2 id="approach-6">Approach</h2>
<p>To &ldquo;Remove the closest <strong>non-star</strong> character to its <strong>left</strong>, as well as remove the star itself&rdquo;, we can use a stack to simulate this process: read the string from left to right (start to end), when we see a non star, we push it to the stack. When we see a star, we pop the last element we pushed (LIFO).</p>
<p>In Python, we can use <code>deque</code> in <code>collections</code>, because it offers $O(1)$ insertion at both the right end  (<code>append</code>) and the left enb (<code>appendleft</code>) and $O(1)$ pop (<code>pop</code>) at the right and the left end (<code>popleft</code>).</p>

<h2 id="approach-7">Approach</h2>
<p>Use <code>deque</code> to simulate stack in python. Make sure the element to be pushed on top of the stack is compatible with elements inside the stack before pushing it.</p>
<p>Invariants:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the stack is empty, push the next element in the array.</li>
<li>If the top element in the stack is negative, push the next element in array no matter it is negative or positive.</li>
<li>If the next element is positive, just push it.</li>
<li>Else (top is positive, next element is negative): crush whatever can be crushed by the next element in the stack: a while loop</li>

<h2 id="approach-8">Approach</h2>
<p>t is in strictly increasing order. If some ping falls outside of the range, it must be in the start of the ping array. This behavior can be simulated using queue (FIFO).</p>
<p>In python, we can use <code>deque</code> to implement a queue: <code>append</code> to push, <code>popleft</code> to pop.</p>

<h2 id="approach-9">Approach</h2>
<p>To fid the middle node, we could use the &ldquo;fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;slow&rdquo; double pointer method. Inside the while loop, by updating the &ldquo;fast&rdquo; pointer twice and the &ldquo;slow&rdquo; pointer once, we can locate the mid node at the &ldquo;slow&rdquo; pointer.</p>
<p>To delete it, we can use another pointer to point to the prev of the &ldquo;slow&rdquo; pointer, and update <code>prev.next</code> to its <code>next.next</code>.</p>

<h1 id="328-odd-even-linked-listhttpsleetcodecomproblemsodd-even-linked-list"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/">328. Odd Even Linked List</a></h1>
<h2 id="appraoch">Appraoch</h2>
<p>The intuition is to maintain a double-pointer structure to this linked-list: the <code>oddNode</code> pointer that first points to the <code>head</code> and the <code>evenNode</code> pointer that first points to <code>head.next</code> .</p>
<p>My first try was to update <code>oddNode.next = oddNode.next.next</code> in a while loop, which essentially gets the oddNode list ready. Then I update the evenNode list similarly. But this did not work, because <code>evenNode.next</code> is the updated oddNode not the original oddNode, and <code>evenNode.next.next</code> is not a evenNode.</p>
<p>To account for that, we need to carefully update oddNode and evenNode <em>in turn</em>. Another thing is that we need to store the head.next in a special variable <code>evenListStart</code> so that the last oddNode knows where it should point to. The last evenNode should point to <code>None</code>.</p>

<h2 id="approach-10">Approach</h2>
<p>We traverse the linked list and do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Store <code>currentNode.next</code> to  <code>nextNode</code>.</li>
<li>Set <code>currentNode.next</code> to <code>prevNode</code></li>
<li>Update <code>prevNode</code> to <code>currentNode</code></li>
<li>Update <code>currentNode</code> to <code>nextNode</code></li>
<li>We need to handle the head and the end of the list a little differently:
<ol>
<li>head of the list does not have <code>prevNode</code>: therefore in step 2, set it to <code>None</code>.</li>
<li>End of the list does not have <code>nextNode</code> (equals <code>None</code>), if we know it is <code>None</code>, we know it is the end and we set it to be the new <code>head</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="background-tree-traversal">Background: Tree traversal</h2>
<p>Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways.</p>
<h3 id="traversal-using-dfs">Traversal using DFS</h3>
<h4 id="inorder-traversal-left-root-right">Inorder Traversal (left, root, right)</h4>
<p>Inorder traversal gives nodes in non-decreasing order.</p>
<h5 id="implementation">Implementation:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Iterative:
<ul>
<li>Keep appending left nodes to the stack until hitting None</li>
<li>Pop the stack to get the node and print it. Go to its right. Goes back to the above step.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recursive:
<ul>
<li>InorderTravese(root.left)</li>
<li>Print (root)</li>
<li>InorderTravese(root.right)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="time-and-space">Time and Space</h5>
<p>Time: $O(n)$</p>
<p>Space: $O(h)$, $h$ is the height of the tree. In the iterative case, $h = len(stack)$. In the recursive case: $h = len(functionStack)$</p>
<h4 id="preorder-traversal-root-left-right">Preorder Traversal (root, left, right)</h4>
<p>Preorder traversal is used to create a copy of the tree.</p>
<h5 id="implementation-1">Implementation:</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Iterative: <em>The right child is pushed before the left child to make sure that the left subtree is processed first.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Pop an item from the stack and print it.</li>
<li>Push right child of a popped item to stack</li>
<li>Push left child of a popped item to stack</li>

<p>The same as InorderTraverse.</p>

<h1 id="338-counting-bitshttpsleetcodecomproblemscounting-bits"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/">338. Counting Bits</a></h1>
<h2 id="approach-12">Approach</h2>
<p>To do it in linear time, the intuition is to use dynamic programming: reuse the result in smaller <code>i</code>s (i from 1 to n) to compute big <code>i</code>s.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to divide <code>i</code> by 2 by using <code>i&gt;&gt;1</code> and access <code>output[i&gt;&gt;1]</code> to get the number of 1s besides the last digit. If the last digit is 1, then we add 1 to the above number; otherwise, add 0. To check if the last digit is 1 or not, we can use <code>i&amp;1</code>.</p>
<h3 id="time-20">Time:</h3>
<p>$O(n)$</p>

<p>$O(1)$</p>
<h1 id="136-single-numberhttpsleetcodecomproblemssingle-number"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/">136. Single Number</a></h1>
<p>Since besides the singled number the list contains numbers all in pair. To cancel themselves out, we can use xor (<code>^</code> in python). We can xor the whole list together and what remains is the single number.</p>
<h3 id="time-21">Time:</h3>

<p>$O(1)$</p>
<h1 id="1-two-sumhttpsleetcodecomproblemstwo-sum"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/">1. Two Sum</a></h1>
<h2 id="approach-13">Approach</h2>
<p>I did not figure it out myself. The most obvious solution is to use a $O(n^2)$ brute-force method. I then try to reduce it to $O(n\log{n})$  by first sorting it, and then use binary search to search for each element&rsquo;s complement in the list. That is another $O(n\log{n})$. This doesn&rsquo;t work becasue</p>

      <description>A Paper a Day: The Philosophy of Art and Aesthetics, Psychology, and Neuroscience: studies in literature, music, and visual arts by Noël Carroll, Margaret Moore, and William P. Seeley</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alexander Baumgarten, 1735: Baumgarten used the phrase episteme aisthetike to mean the science of what is sensed and imagined, in contrast to the science of what is known through rational thought. In his incomplete Aesthetica, Baumgarten further defined the terms as follows: “Aesthetics (the theory of the liberal arts, the logic of the lower capacities of cognition [gnoseologia inferior], the art of thinking beautifully, the art of the analogon rationis) is the science of <strong>sensible cognition</strong>.” Since then, philosophers started exploring topics of:</p>
<ul>
<li>judgments of beauty: faculties of the judging subject and the qualities judged in the object</li>
<li>taste and preference</li>
<li>role of imagination</li>
<li>aesthetic and morality</li>
<li>experience of artwork</li>
</ul>
<p>only with the advent of <strong>cognitive science</strong> in the late 20th century that Baumgarten’s vision of aesthetics as a <em>science</em> of sensory cognition, including the study of our engagement with artworks, has become truly possible.</p>
<h2 id="the-viability-of-aesthetic-as-a-science">The Viability of Aesthetic as a Science</h2>
<ul>
<li>Logical Positivists: preferred to exclude anything that involves subjective feeling from the general domain of knowledge. Science could not, in principle, have any bearing on questions about the nature of art, beauty, or aesthetic appreciation.</li>
<li>analytic philosophers have been generally skeptical about the relevance of psychology to the philosophy of art and aesthetics.
<ul>
<li>Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Lectures in Aesthetics：</li>
<li>George Dickie’s “Is Psychology Relevant to Aesthetics”
<ul>
<li>when we answer aesthetic questions with data concerning the behavioral responses of participants to particular artworks we are committing a category mistake—we confuse a logical problem for a scientific one: what matters in the case of our responses to music is whether the formal composition of the work—in this case, the syntactic features of compositions that constitute a musical language is adequate for the attribution of the aesthetic feature in question. And this, Dickie argues, is a matter of convention rather than psychological causation—a matter of the rules of the particular language game appropriate to the production and appreciation of the category of music used as the stimulus. Questions about the nature of art and the character of aesthetic experience are prior logical questions about the use of a language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refute to Dickie’s arguments: recent imaging studies involving adjective matching and preference orderings support Dickie’s observations but challenge his assessment of the relevance of psychology to aesthetics: correlations among Calvo-Merino’ imaging results revealed common cortical networks subserving participants’ aesthetic judgments. Discussions of the functions of these cortical networks suggest that aesthetic judgments within a medium are realized by a unique set of psychological processes.
<ul>
<li>one can argue against Dickie that our use of aesthetic concepts in ordinary language draws on, reflects, or perhaps even itself constitutes an underlying tacit theory about the nature of art and the character of aesthetic experience; our systematic use of aesthetic terms in ordinary language should yield testable predictions about the nature of art and the character of aesthetic experience. Therefore, even if, as Dickie suggests, the philosopher of art is concerned with language games, a language game can be studied empirically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In below, the essay explores significant interactions between philosophy and psychology with special regard to the arts of literature, music, and visual art.</p>
<h2 id="literature">Literature</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jenefer Robinson’s Deeper than Reason: The Emotions and their Role in Literature, Music and Art.
<ul>
<li>James’s approach to the emotions: it is physiological change that is essential to an emotion. When we perceive something that causes fear, for example, that perception directly causes bodily changes.</li>
<li>judgmentalism: A judgment is an assertion and an assertion entails that we believe its propositional content. Therefore, the judmentalist holds that in order for an emotion to take hold, it is necessary that we have certain beliefs: an emotional state is essentially a judgment.</li>
<li>Robinson&rsquo;s rejection to the judgmentalism:
<ul>
<li>thought experiments (philosophically)
<ul>
<li>imagining cutting finger in half: emotion happens without belief</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>psychological
<ul>
<li>Zajonc has demonstrated that, at least in primitive episodes of emotional response such as the startle reaction, affect can obtain without being caused by any cognitive state</li>
<li>Zajonc and his colleagues have established that people form preferences for stimuli to which they had been previously exposed, but that were presented to them at rates too fast to allow conscious recognition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>neuroscience
<ul>
<li>Joseph LeDoux: &ldquo;Thinking, fast and slow&rdquo;: &ldquo;fast&rdquo; activates the amygdala directly, but then that system is checked by processes operating in the frontal cortex (&ldquo;slow&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the judgmentalist picture, the emotional state begins with a conscious <em>judgment</em>—an evaluation or appraisal of the stimuli: this causes a <em>feeling</em> state in me that puts me on the lookout for more relevant information and primes my <em>behavioral</em> response.</p>
<p>For Robinson, perception -&gt; physiological -&gt; behavioral -&gt; cognition kicks in at this point in the process, monitoring the earlier stages of the process and either endorsing them or modifying them. Robinson believes that changes in the facial musculature and the corresponding alterations of the autonomic nervous system provide some grounds for discriminating between the so-called basic emotions (e.g., anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise). However, she also maintains, as do the judgmentalists, that it is primarily the cognitive processing that attends the emotion that fixes the identity of the affective state.</p>
<p>However, some emotions look like they require a lot of cognition in the form of some antecedent deliberation. Absorbing literature emotionally seems more like the sort of affect that is born of reflection than like a non-cognitive reflex such as the startle response.</p>
<p>Reading a fiction prompts our memory system to recall event types like the ones in the story that provoke immediate, non-cognitive, affective appraisals, and thereby activate physiological changes and behavioral tendencies; this then is cognitively monitored, leading to an adjustment of our appraisal of the situation, refining our understanding of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>cognitively monitoring our emotional responses to literature can provide the foundation of our interpretive response</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt; Therefore, psychology is anything but irrelevant to the philosophy of art: it both contributes to our understanding of and enhances our capacity for narrative appreciation.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<ul>
<li>Plato&rsquo;s Republic: music in different modes affects our mental states in different ways
<ul>
<li>music is something we make direct physical contact with; the emotional and aesthetic effects of music are directly caused by the physical properties of musical sounds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eduard Hanslick’s The Beautiful in Music.
<ul>
<li>our affective responses to music could not involve genuine emotions, for an emotional response is not possible unless its object has some semantic content.
<ul>
<li>similar to judgementalist</li>
<li>in order for us to be saddened by music, the music would have to depict some particular thing that we recognize and react to in a canonical way. But music does not have the semantic resources of a language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similarly, Peter Kivy
<ul>
<li>The inability of music to express emotion literally is a conceptual claim for Kivy—it ultimately rests on our definition of the nature of emotion and the nature of music. Philosophers would do well to recognize that although questions about the nature of music or emotions may be partly conceptual questions, they are also <strong>empirical questions</strong>. Indeed, even where they are conceptual questions, our concepts continue to evolve as they are influenced by scientific developments.
<ul>
<li>the study of subject and object: perceptual psychology, the science of acoustics, affective neuroscience, cognition, emotion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="music-imagery">Music Imagery</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wittgenstein, Ryle, and Scruton: imagining is simply an attitude we take. Rather than believing that we hear a melody when there is no actual sound present, we merely imagine the sound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“imagination” is currently used to refer to any one of several related concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>imagination as the production of mental imagery</li>
<li>imagination as a faculty that organizes percepts for coherent cognition (the constructive imagination)
<ul>
<li>Kant argues that the imagination is responsible for shaping sensory information from perception so that it is available to our understanding, or coherent to us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>imagination in the sense of being imaginative or creative</li>
<li>imagination as a propositional attitude taken towards fictional or imaginary propositions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hume’s A Treatise of Human Nature: the imagination is a storehouse of ideas derived from past perceptions
=&gt; Cognition is a capacity that always needs the imagination, since it involves the comparison of present perceptions to past perceptions, or the application of general concepts, which are formed by the imagination. Having an image of something not present also involves the imagination, since this involves either the recall of a past idea from the imagination, or the construction of a new idea out of past ideas. To be imaginative in the sense of being creative, then, is to be especially innovative in constructing new ideas, whether these ideas are imagistic (i.e., sensory) or abstract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visual imagery has dominated mental imagery research in the late 20th century. These studies have demonstrated that imagery preserves key metrical properties of perceptual representations in a target modality, that it draws on the same neurophysiological processes as perception in a target modality, and that the capacity for imagery is disrupted by both focal damage and the application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the discrete brain regions that realize these perceptual processes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kosslyn, Ball, and Reiser: differences in the time it takes to answer questions about the presence of targets on a <em>memorized</em> map are proportional to the distances one would have to scan to locate them on the original.</li>
<li>Shepard and Metzler: differences in the time it takes for participants to evaluate whether an object is identical to a target in mental rotation studies are proportional to the distance the former would have to be rotated to match the latter.</li>
<li>imaging studies demonstrate that visual imagery tasks employ the same areas of the cerebral cortex that are involved in ordinary perception</li>
<li>Bisiach and Luzzatti: selective damage to one side of the cerebral cortex causes patients to fail to perceive objects in associated areas of the visual field, generalize to visual imagery.</li>
<li>Kosslyn and his colleagues have demonstrated that the use of rTMS to disrupt activity in areas of the cerebral cortex involved in the encoding of sensory information in visual experience also disrupts the capacity in normal perceivers to use imagery and visualization to make spatial comparisons among the parts of recollected visual stimuli</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auditory imagery experiments confirm that the metric properties (pitch, rhythm, and timbre) of auditory perception are preserved in auditory imagery: auditory imagery draws on the same neurophysiological processes in the auditory cortex as ordinary hearing, and that focal damage to these areas disrupts auditory imagery.</p>
<ul>
<li>Halpern: asked participants to identify whether a lyric was part of a song or not. Those asked to mentally play through the song took longer to respond than those who were not, and differences in their response times were proportional to the musical time between the target lyrics</li>
<li>In a second experiment, Halpern asked participants to identify whether a note corresponding to a lyric was higher or lower in pitch than the starting note. Some subjects could not do this at all. However, those with musical training were better than non-musicians, and differences in response times were more pronounced than in
the previous experiment.</li>
<li>the evidence seems to point towards a representation that
<ul>
<li>codes extension in time</li>
<li>unfolds in real time</li>
<li>has strong links between adjacent element</li>
<li>unidirectionally ordered</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall, these studies in psychology and neuroscience support the hypothesis that “parts of the cortex specialized for processing actual sound are also recruited to process imagined sound.” This, in turn, lends support for the phenomenological intuition that the experience of imagery is importantly like the experience of perception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auditory memories seem to be stored as past auditory percepts, and can be recalled in a way that reproduces the pitch and temporal details of the original auditory experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zatorre and Halpern review evidence that suggests that it is plausible to think that composers who report “hearing” their compositions internally are drawing on the same capacity for auditory imagery used to rehearse a remembered piece of music. Hearing a piece that one already knows involves reviving an auditory image of that piece, drawing upon memory stores that function as a kind of constructive imagination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>neural underpinnings of auditory imagery elucidates an important component of the musical listening experience</p>
<ul>
<li>musical capacities are highly variable: both listening to and performing music seems to alter the very structure of the brain - arguably, what is happening is the formation of <strong>aural/musical categories</strong> for the components of music as well as for entire compositions.
<ul>
<li>2 possibilities:
<ul>
<li>musical ability relevant to music listening can be developed later in life</li>
<li>there are limits to what listening capacities many people can develop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="visual-art">Visual art</h2>
<p>Cogintive Science: is the study of the way organisms acquire, recognize, manipulate, and use information in the production of behavior (the input and the output and their relationship): perceptual, affective, and cognitive</p>
<p>Current research in the cognitive neuroscience of visual art lies at the confluence of two broad research strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>empirical aesthetics: examine behavioral responses to artworks.</li>
<li>aesthetic experimentalism: the view that visual artists develop formal and compositional vocabularies by trial and error, or through a systematic exploration of the perceptual effects of different sets of marks, color schemes, and compositional arrangements. Therefore, we can learn about the operations of perceptual systems by examining the productive strategies of artists</li>
</ul>
<p>cognitive neuroscience of visual art rests on the assumption that correlations between the <strong>formal features of artworks</strong> and basic <strong>neurophysiological</strong> mechanisms in the visual system can be used to explain how visual artworks work as perceptual stimuli. A good deal of research in the cognitive neuroscience of visual art is dedicated to searching out and explaining these relationships between the formal strategies employed by artists and the operations of the visual system.</p>
<ul>
<li>visual system is a set of evolved biological mechanisms whose function is to select information from sensory inputs that is sufficient for visual recognition and action</li>
<li>The input to the visual system is replete with information about the local environment. However, only a small fraction of this information is diagnostic for the identity of an object, action, or event at any given time.</li>
<li>Artists’ formal methods and vocabularies are tools for selecting features sufficient for object, action, and event recognition from ordinary perceptual experience and rendering them in a medium</li>
</ul>
<p>Artworks can be thought of as artifacts intentionally designed to direct attention (perceptually sailent) to their artistically salient features (perceptual features responsible for the aesthetic effects and semantic associations)</p>
<h3 id="3-case-studies">3 case studies</h3>
<h4 id="georges-seurats-bathers-at-asnières">Georges Seurat’s Bathers at Asnières</h4>
<p>Georges Seurat used a formal technique called irradiation to enhance edges and amplify figure–ground segregation in Bathers at Asnières</p>
<ul>
<li>Irradiation is derived from the observation of Mach bands in ordinary perception, but has been used by painters long ago.
<ul>
<li>Mach band: Lateral inhibition helps boost the perception of object edges
<ul>
<li>A ganglion cell in the retina receives excitatory signals from photoreceptors and inhibitory signals from other ganglion cells that surround it. Ganglion cells along the bright side of the border between these regions receive less inhibition from their neighbors on the dark side. The overall response of these cells will therefore be higher than their neighbors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>one function of lateral inhibition is to amplify the intensity of a feature of the sensory input that defines the boundaries between objects in perception. This in turn contributes to form recognition by enhancing the contrast between figure and ground, thereby sharpening the perception of depth in the picture plane.</p>
<p>An artists’ formal vocabulary =&gt; its utility in paintings is explained by neurophysiological mechanisms in the visual system.</p>
<p>However, although this case study demonstrates that cognitive neuroscience can contribute to our understanding of the way paintings work as perceptual stimuli, it does not establish irradiated edges as <strong>artistically salient</strong> features of Bathers at Asnières, because Mach band is everywhere in the real life but we do not find all of them aesthetically pleasing =&gt; if the nature of art can be explained in terms of ordinary psychological processes subserving our engagement with artworks, one needs an additional explanation to determine what, if anything, differentiates artworks from ordinary artifacts.</p>
<h3 id="mona-lisa">Mona Lisa</h3>
<p>Sfumato is a formal technique in which artists blur the sharp edges that define object features in a painting. Leonardo used this technique to render the critical facial features that define Mona Lisa’s expression, the corners of her mouth and eyes. Gombrich argues that these sfumato contours introduce a degree of ambiguity into the painting that forces viewers to use their imagination to interpret an expression that cannot ever be discretely resolved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Livingstone has demonstrated that differences between the spatial resolution of peripheral and foveal vision explain how sfumato works to generate the dynamics of Mona Lisa’s expression
<ul>
<li>We are able to discern remarkably fine-grained visual detail in the central, or foveal, region of the visual field, but nearly blind to visual features defined by coarse-grained visual information; converse is true for peripheral vision. Livingstone reports that the spatial resolution of normal vision diminishes by a factor of 10 just 7 degrees from the central.
<ul>
<li>This difference in spatial resolution between central, or foveal, and peripheral vision is explained by the fact that the receptive fields of peripheral retinal neurons are dramatically larger than those of their foveal counterparts: foveal neurons are sensitive to sharp, narrow-luminance boundaries that carry high-spatial-frequency information, but are unable to register coarse, broad-luminance gradients, like contours rendered in sfumato, that carry low- and medium-spatial-frequency information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Smile is &ldquo;represented&rdquo; using sfumato in low and medium spatial frequencies: when one foveates on Mona Lisa’s smile it disappears; the smile reappears in a viewer’s peripheral field when he or she looks away.</p>
<p>Gombrich VS Livingstone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gombrich: a viewer’s interpretation of Mona Lisa’s expression should vary with his or her state of mind</li>
<li>Livingstone: he depicted expression varies systematically with the distance of one’s focus of attention from the center of Mona Lisa’s face</li>
</ul>
<p>However, similarly, it does not establish sfumatoed smile as <strong>artistically salient</strong> feature because of the same reason.
Nonetheless, Livingstone’s discussion contributes evidence in support of a particular hypothesis about the aesthetic quality of the painting.</p>
<p>Theories about the nature of art and aesthetic experience rest ultimately on their <strong>consistency</strong> with facts about the way we engage with particular artworks =&gt; vision science, or psychology in general can serve as constraints to help decide among competing theories.</p>
<h3 id="slave-market-with-the-disappearing-bust-of-voltaire">Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire</h3>
<p>Dalí’s painting is a bistable ambiguous image (like the duck/rabbit image). The bistability is an artistically salient feature of the painting that generates both the perceptual ambiguity and the range of semantic associations that are constitutive of its identity as an artwork.</p>
<p>Bonnar and her colleagues used a technique called <strong>frequency-specific</strong> adaptation to demonstrate that this high- and low-spatial-frequency information was selectively used to drive the perception of either the nuns or the bust of Voltaire in the painting.</p>
<ul>
<li>the nuns were more apparent in the high-spatial-frequency images and the bust of Voltaire was more apparent in the low-spatial-frequency images.</li>
<li>hypothesis: Frequency-specific adaptation can be used to desensitize the visual system to the particular spatial-frequency information presented in a stimulus. participants adapted to high-spatial-frequency information should see the bust of Voltaire and participants adapted to low-spatial-frequency information should see the two nuns.</li>
<li>Participants were primed with either high- (first group) or low-spatial-frequency (2nd group) dynamic noise. THe first group reported seeing Voltaire; the 2nd saw nuns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>We can come to understand the nature of art and aesthetic experience by tracking the relationship between the formal and compositional structure of particular artworks and viewers’ behavioral responses.</p>
<p>The model that emerges defines artworks as attentional strategies intentionally designed to direct attention and enhance the perception of features diagnostic for their artistically salient aesthetic (e.g., Mona Lisa’s elusive smile) and semantic (e.g., the bistable ambiguous content of Dalí’s painting) content.</p>
<p>These case studies each demonstrate a role for exogenous, stimulus-driven attentional processes in our engagement with artworks. However, attention is also <strong>endogenously</strong> driven by knowledge and expectations. Research suggests that artworks are attentional strategies that harness both basic formal features and viewers’ semantic knowledge, including art historical knowledge of the unique sets of formal strategies used to categorize artworks as belonging to artistic types (e.g., the works of particular artists, schools, or epochs), to convey their content.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>more work needs to be done to determine how to <strong>isolate and model</strong> the types of aesthetic and semantic effects used to categorize artifacts as artworks.</li>
<li>one needs a way to constrain our understanding of formal structure to just those features and relations that contribute to the function of an artifact as an artwork.
<ul>
<li>functional rather than descriptive</li>
<li>the functional sense provides a principled means not only to recover the content of the work without demanding explicit prior knowledge of an artist’s actual intentions, but also to evaluate the adequacy of competing interpretations of those intentions.</li>

<ul>
<li>The opening chapter of the book <em>Aesthetics of Science</em> by Arthur P.Shimamura
<ul>
<li>draws on ideas, identifies issues in aesthetics science from philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="problem-space-what-is-aesthetics">Problem Space: what is aesthetics</h2>
<ul>
<li>aesthetics when it was coined by Alexander Baumgarten: the study of how to mind beholds beautiful objects
<ul>
<li>aesthetic response/experience: feelings of beauty; certain physical properties of an object may evoke it, but the experience itself is purely subjective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now: all kinds of <em>hedonic</em> response (a preference judgment) to a sensory experience
<ul>
<li>all kinds of emotion: beauty, anger, horror (emotion)</li>
<li>pique sensory processes (perception)</li>
<li>new idea, past experience (conception)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who: beholder&rsquo;s experience, not artist&rsquo;s. Highlight the ways in which art is perceived, interpreted (conceptual), and felt (emotional).</li>
<li>object of interest: art (some art may be anti-aesthetic), natural phenomena, objects not intended to be art</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="philosophical-4-approaches-that-highlights-different-aspects-of-human-psychological-experiences">Philosophical: 4 approaches that highlights different aspects of human psychological experiences</h2>
<h3 id="mimetic-an-imitation-of-the-real-world">Mimetic: an imitation of the real world</h3>
<p>Plato: art is at best a twice removal from the ideal world
Aristotle: art could rarify essential univerals
In paintings, artists create the illusion of objects in 3-D space on a 2-D surface , a feat that requires the knowledge of reverse-engineering the human vision.</p>
<ul>
<li>linear perspective and chiaroscuro</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="expressionist-express-and-induce-emotions">Expressionist: express and induce emotions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Francis Hutcheson: feelings of beauty and pleasure, independent of the object&rsquo;s purpose or function; subjective feelings but there are absolute standards.</li>
<li>David Hume: beauty is purely subjective (taste), because it is not in objects themselves. But there is universal standards on taste.</li>
<li>Kant: We interpret the world by linking sensory experience to pre-existing concepts or ideas (cognitive approach).
<ul>
<li>judgments of taste =&gt; decide what gives us pleasureable feelings</li>
<li>features of objects that are pleasureable: agreeable, good, and beautiful. Aesthetic judgements are judgments/evaluations of beautiful things</li>
<li>beauty: innate idea, a universal concept =&gt; Aesthetic judgments are both subjective (experience) and universal (innate, universal concept of beauty)</li>
<li>sublime: not a proeprty of an object, it is a feeling to be elicited.</li>
<li>aesthetic judgments are not associated with an object’s function or purpose: disinterested =&gt; art for art&rsquo;s sake, Romanticism</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="formalist-abstract-the-sensory-quality">Formalist: abstract the sensory quality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clement Greenberg about painting: 2-D is 2-D, not an illusion of 3-D. Impressionism.</li>
<li>Clive Bell: the essence of the aesthetic experience as per- ceiving significant <em>form</em>. The beholder considers an artwork purely on the basis of sensory features—that is, the aesthetic interplay of colors, lines, textures, and shapes: content and objects in a painting are irrelevant.</li>
<li>The advent of photographs moved artist away from mimetic and expressionist approaches to a formalist approach.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conceptual-convey-a-concept">Conceptual: convey a concept</h3>
<ul>
<li>prehistory art: convey a message, often to a higher being.</li>
<li>post-modernism: meta-art: try to explore the nature/meaning of art
<ul>
<li>ex: Duchamp&rsquo;s <em>Fountain</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>requires knowledge about the symbolic referents displayed in an artwork. To appreciate meta-art statements, it is necessary to have knowledge about art history and the various ways art has been defined.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summarization-of-philosophical-approaches">Summarization of Philosophical approaches</h3>
<p>Each of these approaches highlights different aspects of the beholder’s mental processes involved in the art experience: sensory processes with mimetic and formalist approaches, emotional processes with an expressionist approach, and semantic or cognitive processes with a conceptual approach.</p>
<h2 id="empirical-approaches-psychological-science">Empirical Approaches: Psychological Science</h2>
<h3 id="perception">Perception</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gustav Fechner, 1860: Psychophysics: the ways in which physical stimuli are registered by the mind.
<ul>
<li>Fechner, 1876: psychophysics of aesthetics. He suggested that aesthetics could be studied from the bottom up (elemental perceptual features): preference judgments for basic shapes, colors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gestalt psychology, early 20th century: perceptions could not be dissected into basic elements. It is the organization of a visual scene that we interpret and not the elemental features; the principle of Prägnanz, the notion that we organize our perceptions based on the simplest or most succinct interpretations.
<ul>
<li>Rudolf Arnheim applied Gestalt principles to the study of visual aesthetics. His Gestaltist interpretations stressed the manner in which the organization and dynamics of perceptual features act to create interest- ing works of art. He described paintings with respect to the “perceptual forces” that artists induced through balance, harmony, and object placement, anf these forces give rise to aesthetic experiences, such as a sense of calm or tenseness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="emotion">Emotion</h3>
<p>Daniel Berlyne:</p>
<ul>
<li>optimally pleasing artworks are those that create some arousal or psychological tension but not so much that they become disturbing.</li>
<li>arousal is determined by specific features of artworks, such as novelty, complexity, surprisingness, uncertainty, and incongruity: they must work together to produce emotion, the greater the nuumber of those features, the greater the arousal.
<ul>
<li>the features are not properties of the object, but related to the beholder’s past experience and knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="empirical-approaches-cognitive-science">Empirical Approaches: Cognitive Science</h2>
<ul>
<li>draws heavily on computer-based models of how the mind works.</li>
<li>information processing approach: the way sensory signals act as information that is encoded, interpreted, represented, and stored.
<ul>
<li>bottom up: from sensory signals to knowledge
<ul>
<li>Gustav Fechner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>top down: the use of knowledge to direct what we perceive (knowing is seeing, conceptual)
<ul>
<li>Ernst Gombrich
<ul>
<li>Based on our personal and cultural knowledge, the beholder forms expectations that help interpret an artwork and direct viewing to salient features</li>
<li>All art is illusory and we must build an interpretation of what an artwork represents based on existing knowledge (Schema): art as symbols</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="empirical-approaches-neuroscience">Empirical Approaches: Neuroscience</h2>
<p>Neuroscientists have studied the workings of the brain from many levels of analysis—from analyses of individual brain cells (i.e., neurons) to the study of neural activity in the human brain. Both structural (anatomical) and functional (brain activity) analyses have been used to investigate the neural correlates of human cognitive function.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Prefrontal cortex (PFC): It receives inputs from other brain regions and sends projections back to these regions. In this way, the PFC coordinates and controls neural processing: top down processing</li>
<li>Korbinian Brodmann, 1909: defined 52 distinct areas in cerebral cortex on the basis of physical features, such as size, shape, and density (Brodmann areas).</li>
<li>Neuropsychological: the study of the relationship between behavior, emotion, and cognition on the one hand, and brain function on the other
<ul>
<li>observing the way damage to different parts of the brain disrupts cognitive function
<ul>
<li>case of Phineas Gage</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li>Neuroimaging: fMRI: neuroscientists can assess brain activity in specific regions, virtually on a moment-to-moment basis

      <title>Shapes and Functions of the Lekythos</title>

      <description>This paper investigates the ways ancient Greek associated the word (λήκυθος and its variants, the English equivalent is the word Lekythos) with the various shapes and functions of certain containers.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="lekythos-its-etymology">Lekythos, its etymology</h2>
<p>The Greek word <em>lekythos</em> had a broader meaning than the modern, archaeological term “lekythos.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It was a generic term for oil or perfume jug.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Evidence could be found in the literature: in Aristophanes’ Ploutos, a lekythos is used as a vessel for oil<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>; in his play <em>Birds</em>, a slave of Pisthetaerus exclaims, &ldquo;there is no oil in the lekythos&rdquo;.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> In fact, the earliest use of the term occurs in Homer’s Odyssey, where Nausicaa is given olive oil in a golden lekythos by her mother to anoint herself.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Besides the literary evidence, an inscription found on a vase that the archaeologists now call aryballos (a small, rounded oil bottle used by ancient athletes) says that it is a <em>lekythos</em> owned by Asopodoros.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Alabastron, in addition to aryballos, was also called <em>lekythos</em>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> To sum up, the term <em>lekythos</em>, rather than pinpointing certain shapes in ancient Greece, was a term used to denote the function of certain pots, namely, a flask for carrying oil or perfume, or unguents.</p>
<h2 id="lekythos-archaeologically-speaking">Lekythos, archaeologically speaking</h2>
<p>In the modern, archaeological sense, lekythos refers to a variety of shapes that share certain features that distinguish them from, say, aryballos or alabastron: one-handled, narrow neck, and deep mouth.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Archaeologists identify and distinguish between three main types of Attic Lekythos that were developed starting from the sixth century.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Type One has a body that continuously and gently curves from neck to base (which makes it look like it does not have a neck).<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> Type One, or the Deianeira lekythoi, appeared in the early sixth century B.C. as an essentially black-figure shape (most of them use the black-figure technique).<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> It continued to be used until the third quarter of the century.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Type Two, the shoulder lekythoi, aptly gets its name from its distinct shoulder. It was introduced around 570 – 560 B.C.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> and continued to be made until the end of the fifth century. Around 530 B.C. this type achieves its standard cylindrical form (unlike earlier shoulder lekythoi, whose body turn sharply towards the base, the cylindrical lekythoi have a cylindrical body that does not turn at all).<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> In fact, the development of the shape of Type Two was decisively affected by the introduction of the new red-figure style (also invented around 530 B.C.).<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Therefore, the cylindrical form could enjoy both the black-figure and the red-figure (as well as the white-ground technique as we will later see) techniques. It is the most common type among existing lekythoi.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Type Three is the squat type that is broad at the base and has no distinct shoulder. It becomes popular starting from the second half of the fifth century. Some think that this form is popular during the fourth century<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>, but others think that it phases out a decade after it replaces the cylindrical form at the end of the fifth century. Given its circulation time, Type Three is essentially a red-figure shape<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Besides the three major Attic lekythos shapes that are popular during the Archaic and the Classical period, archeologists also use the term lekythos to refer to Sub-Mycenae and Protogeometric vessels with bulbous body, thin neck, strap handle, and flaring foot<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="a-lekythos-in-the-chazen-museum">A Lekythos in the Chazen Museum</h2>
<p>The vase I chose is of cylindrical shape.
<img src="front.jpeg" alt="front view" width="400"/></p>
<p><strong>Front view (note its size from the other lekythos)</strong></p>
<img src="detail.jpeg" alt="detailed view" width="400"/>
<p><strong>A detailed view on the painting</strong></p>
<p>Like all other lekythoi exhibited in the museum except for the one that is of squat shape. Its inventory number is Chazen 70.2.</p>
<p>The subject of the vase painting is two women on their way to somewhere, each carrying a basket. The baskets they prepared have lekythos and some ribbons or sashes. The black dress of one woman is a mourning cloak, and it matches the color of the basket of the other woman, and conversely, the woman with the white dress matches the color of the other basket. Between their eyes, there is an inscription that spelled “kalos”, which means “beautiful”. I am not sure whether the inscription is trying to tell us about the beauty of the two women. Also, the meaning of such an inscription in a funeral scene is unclear.</p>
<p>From the second quarter of the fifth century, around the time when this vase was made (ca. 460 B.C.), lekythos painted with the white-ground technique is almost exclusively funerary. The scenes painted, like this one, are illustrative of Athenian rites of death and burial.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> White lekythos are often specially made for funerals because oil was believed to be important to the dead as well as to the living, therefore they are made as offerings to the dead. Also, white slips are less stable and thus impractical for daily use, but it is perfectly fine to be used as funeral gifts<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. The dimension of this vase is 15 7/8 by 5 1/4 inches. It is relatively large when compared with other lekythoi. Since it was made for funeral uses, its size was not limited by handiness<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To sum up, the size of this vase, its technique used, and the subject matter suggest and are determined by its function.</p>
<h2 id="the-function-of-lekythos">The Function of Lekythos</h2>
<p>It was discussed above in the etymology section that lekythos in the broader sense refers to a container of oil (or unguents that is also “oily”, or perfume that is made from oil). Therefore, we know that the main function of those three types of vases discussed above that fall under what we now call lekythos is to hold oil, potentially for storing and distributing. However, the same can be said to be true of what we now call aryballos and alabastron. I think the reason that they are all suitable for storing and pouring oil is that they share the narrow neck feature that distinguishes them from say, water jugs. The narrow neck was designed so that the flow of oil was limited to a thin stream or to drops.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Nonetheless, a call for some finer distinctions from such a generalization is unavoidable. Specifically, if they were said to hold oils, why did Greeks need and devise different shapes for the same use? In other words, do the differences in shape and size contribute to slightly different uses? Also, are they used in different places or contexts?</p>
<p>One way to approach these questions is to connect the variety of uses of oil (and its derivatives) in ancient Greek to the variety of shapes that could hold oil. Oil was very popular then and could be used as offerings and dedications for the dead, as prizes for victorious athletes<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, as a scented perfume<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>, for consumption, and in bathing.</p>
<p>Aryballos, a shape of size smaller than lekythos and alabastron on average (7 or 8 cm<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>) and often rounded, has a small handle (or an ear) used for attaching a strap to the user’s wrist. The small size, attachability, and rounded body that enables easy grabbing contribute to its portability and usability in bathing. Therefore, aryballoi are used by athletes or youths at the bath<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. The evidence of such attribution can be found in multiple vase paintings that show either aryballos was suspended from the wrist of an athlete, or it was hanged on the wall, or it was used in bathing.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> Statistically, using the Beazley Archive, I found that out of 655 vases that are decorated with aryballos, 574 of them include “Draped” as the decoration Termword, many of which depict women bathing. 368 (over half) out of the 655 vases include youth(s) as the subject. I randomly sampled several of them and all of them show youth taking bath. The same can be said of the 166 vases with athletes as subjects. Another good statistical evidence is that 304 of them include sponges, which means likely all of them depict bathing scenes, and the inclusion of the sponge is likely a sufficient but not necessary condition for a bathing scene. Furthermore, non-bathing paintings that include aryballos often depict a youth/athlete walking or doing something with the aryballos attached to his wrist, showing its portability: it is hard to imagine shapes like lekythos could be carried like this and be used in bathing.</p>
<p>Alabastron has an elongated body with mostly a rounded bottom that might need a stand for support<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> (though there are flat-bottomed variations<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>). It either has no handle or has small lugs or handles to attach strings<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. However, it is not totally clear to me how the shape of an alabastron connects to its function as a perfume bottle<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>, at least not as clear as in the case of aryballos<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. So again, I turn to the representations of alabastron in vase paintings. One major type of scene that includes alabastron is “domestic” (308 out of 560), and some “seated” scenes that are not categorized as “domestic” (another 95) are also quite “domestic” in my opinion<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Therefore, “domestic” scenes are the dominant type. The inclusion of objects like “mirror” (131), chairs (98), and stools (75) also contributes to the “domesticity” of the scenes, therefore making the vase attractive to the targeted buyers of perfume, women, because it reflects the ideal life or the needs of the contemporary women. For example, the inclusion of mirrors might reflect the self-awareness of women, of themselves, and of their beauty.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup></p>
<p>The second but relatively minor type of scene is the “funerary” type (85 occurrences out of 560). Objects usually included in a funeral are also included: sash (60), fillet (51), stele (42), and lekythos (41, the funerary use of lekythos will be discussed later). The common subjects that are depicted across those two types of scenes are women: woman takes part in both domestic affairs and in funerals.</p>
<h3 id="lekythos-in-the-narrow-sense">Lekythos in the Narrow Sense</h3>
<p>Let us turn to lekythos, after describing the shapes and uses of its two “close” brothers.</p>
<h4 id="funeral-uses">Funeral Uses</h4>
<p>Besides being a generic term for oil or perfume jug, lekythos in Greek literature is also associated with something that is buried or burnt with the dead, i.e., it is for funeral uses. In Aristophanes’ Ecclesiazusae, three such associations are made: Blepyrus describes the way Praxagora left him as the way “the dead are left, bar the chaplets and perfumes (in lekythos)”<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>; the young man refers to “the most gifted of painters” as someone “who paints the lekythoi on coffins”<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>; the young man commands the first old woman to prepare things for a funeral, and the preparation involves “spreading out a layer of origanum upon four pieces of wood; binding fillets round your head, bringing lekythoi of scent and placing a bowl filled with lustral water before your door”<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition to literary evidence, we can find in Beazley’s archive that out of the 128<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> vases that contain lekythos as part of the scene depicted, 69 (over half) of them are depicting a funeral. Moreover, funeral scenes usually involve at least a woman (42 out of 69). In fact, if a scene includes (at least) a woman and (at least) a lekythos, then it is guaranteed to be a funeral scene. Among the objects that are depicted in a funeral scene (that also includes a lekythos), a stele, a wooden or stone slab that is served as a grave marker, is depicted most frequently (43 out of 69). Basket (33 occurrences), sash (20), and fillets (16), along with stele, are “companions” of the lekythos as they might be used together in an Athenian funeral. These statistics, except that of the stele, confirm the literature evidence mentioned above and the funeral scene depicted in the Chazen lekythos 70.2, providing us with some sense of what was going on in Athenian funerals. Another striking evidence for the use of lekythoi in funerals is that most funeral scenes that contain lekythoi are painted on lekythoi (53 out of 69), whereas non-funeral scenes that contain lekythoi are painted on various other shapes with a relatively small portion of them are painted on lekythoi (22 out of 61). This evidence shows that not only lekythoi are illustrated as part of a funeral (they are painted so), but they are actually used in funerals (they are painted on lekythoi that presumably would later be used in funerals). As for the painting techniques used in funeral scenes that have lekythoi, they are painted predominantly using the white-ground technique (47 out of 69). Connecting to the previous observation<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>, incidentally, all of them are painted on lekythoi.  As a result, white lekythoi’s (lekythos painted using the white-ground technique) primary function was funerary<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We have now established the connection between funerals and white lekythos. However, why does such a connection exist in the first place? What are other uses of lekythoi during a funeral other than burying them with the dead so that the dead could enjoy the same life as the living? The white background is desired because it goes well with the marble grave monument and the bones.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> Moreover, white lekythoi use the same material as the contemporary wall- and panel-paintings and are desired because they remind people of those paintings.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> Shape-wise, most white lekythoi are of cylindrical shape that is straight-sided. I think the cylindrical shape provides the painter with a wall-like canvas and painters might paint or the buyer might desire paintings with the wall-painting style because of its monumentality.<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> Late in the fifth century, some massive examples called the &lsquo;Huge Lekythoi&rsquo; are produced (up to 1m), serving perhaps as equivalents for stone grave-markers.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> I think the ability to achieve such scale is in part due to the secure foot that is lacking from alabastron. Another use in the funeral setting is enabled by the innovation in shape: small interior is made inside the lekythos around 470. B.C.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>
<img src="inner.jpg" alt="the innovation inside" width="200"/></p>
<p>The interior vessel is added, as some scholars believe, to accommodate lekythos’ use for libation by making pouring oil easier, and because libation does not require much oil<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>.</p>
<p>White lekythos, however, is only a subset of all lekythoi, although they are represented more often than other types because of their use in funerals. Another group of scenes besides funerary is “domesticity”. Objects appeared dominantly with alabastrons, such as mirror (21 occurrences out of 128), chair (18), stool (16), and states like “seated” (54) and “domestic” (37) suggest similar usage, or at least, similar marketing targets as the alabastron. Therefore, it is no strange that lekythoi were mainly used by women as containers for oil and perfumed oil.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this essay, I am attempting to analyze the shape(s) and function(s) of lekythos. We start with finding out how Greeks used the term lekythos and find out that the term defines its function rather than its shape. From there we get a first taste of the function of lekythos. Then we explore how archeological convention defines the term and the subgroups that are embodied in the same term. This time, the focus is instead on shape<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. We then visit a lekythos in Chazen and discuss specifically the shape and function of this specific instance that hopefully will lead to a more general discussion later. After that, we focus on the differences in terms of the shape and function between aryballos, alabastron, and lekythos. We analyze the function of certain shape by looking at its representations and figure out the major functions by counting the frequencies of certain objects or certain states. Furthermore, it is shown that the function is influenced by shape. It is also shown that certain shapes are developed to accommodate new functions.</p>

<p>A side note: a slightly strange thing is that, although there are only around 1500 aryballos in the Beazley Archive, 655 representations of aryballos are found on all types of vases. A similar ratio is achieved by alabastron, where 564 representations are found and 1500 alabastrons are recorded in the Archive. However, in the case of lekythos, over 16000 lekythoi are in the Archive, but only 128 vases have painted lekythos on them. This disproportion might be explained in several ways: 1. Greek painters just refrained from painting lekythos for some reason, relatively to the other 2 shapes; 2. in ancient Greek, there used to be much more aryballos and alabastron, but only a very small proportion exists now. Since lekythos are used as offerings, most of them are kept. I don’t know which one is correct.&#160;<a href="#fnref:39" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li>BEETHOVEN | Piano Concerto No. 5, Emperor</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="suite-for-strings">Suite for Strings</h1>
<p>Leoš Janáček, along with Dvořák and Bedřich Smetana we&rsquo;ve covered in class, is considered one of the best Czech composers. He is a diligent worker, although he did not become famous until he was fiftyish. By the time he was in his 70s, he was well-sought after and someone asked him if he had any unshown work, he searched through his archives and took out this work which he composed fifty years ago at the age of 24. At that time, a composer was considered a serious one only if he/she had composed a suite for strings, so he did, although the piece went rather unnoticed.</p>
<p>Because of the wide range of moods it tries to depict, this piece has a relatively equal share of play for each part of the strings. For example, in movement V, the cello steals the spotlight and performs an extremely calm, sad, and legato melody. The mood change is also suggested by the tempo of each movement: besides the first (Moderato) and the last movement (Andante), the tempo goes from Adagio to Andante, and finally peaks at Presto, then it recedes to Adagio, where the solo cello plays. The Presto movement is like the lively 3rd movement of Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s 6th Symphony, whereas the Adagio movement is a sharp contrast in terms of tempo and mood that is comparable to the 4th movement of the 6th Symphony. Moreover, this piece has more symmetry in addition to the symmetric tempo. The melody played in the first movement, the intro, is &ldquo;recapped&rdquo; in the last movement as if Janáček wants to close the loop.</p>
<p>My favorite movement is the last movement. It sounds like the orchestra is recovered from the sadness of the 5th movement. There is one section where it sounds like the dialogue between the lower strings and the upper strings: the lower strings first pose a daunting question (a four-note downward tune), the upper strings respond by repeating the question with a lower dynamic (imitating) as if the person being asked is unsure and unconfident. Then the upper strings press on and repeat asking the same question again while raising the volume, but this time the upper strings vary the question a bit and continue playing without the interruption of the lower strings.</p>
<h1 id="symphony-in-d-major">Symphony in D Major</h1>
<p>Although his works besides opera are not among the most-played repertoire now, Luigi Cherubini was regarded by Beethoven as the greatest of his contemporaries (not sure if Beethoven included himself). In particular, this work is one of the few existed orchestra works between Mozart and Haydn and the array of romantic composers starting from Felix Mendelssohn, besides the Beethoven repertoire. Therefore, he could be seen as a transitional figure between the classical era and the romantic era. While he was in charge of the Conservatoire de Paris, Cherubini mentored Rossini, who really admired his opera work, Chopin, and Berlioz who described Cherubini as a crotchety pedant after refusing to leave when he crossed the &ldquo;female&rdquo; door without knowing he shouldn&rsquo;t be because of the rule made by Cherubini and then being chased by Cherubini and his assistants around the library&rsquo;s tables.</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that Cherubini is the type of person portrayed by Berlioz and by Adolphe Adam who wrote &ldquo;some maintain his temper was very even, because he was always angry.&rdquo; On the contrary, this symphony is really elegant, lighthearted, and beautiful: it mainly uses strings and woodwinds, and only rarely some timpani can be heard. It is in sharp contrast to Beethoven&rsquo;s symphonies. When Cherubini was commissioned in 1815 to compose this work, the first 8 symphonies of Beethoven had been published and must be known to him, but he chose not to rely on brass and percussion to maintain the lightness. Since Cherubini only uses strings and woodwinds in this work, he often engages the two parts in conversations and imitations to have a sense of playfulness. A prominent example could be seen in the 3rd movement, a Minuet, where a string melody is answered by a light one-note played by the flute. I highly doubt that there is any &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; element in this work that makes people ponder rather than slightly raises the corners of people&rsquo;s mouths. The first and the 3rd movement are maybe the most relaxed movements I have heard, something for people at that time to consider after listening to Beethoven&rsquo;s 5th Symphony.</p>
<h1 id="piano-concerto-no-5-the-emperor">Piano Concerto No. 5, the Emperor</h1>
<p>Speaking of Beethoven, here he is, the emperor. He is arguably the emperor of classical music, maybe of music in general, although he hates the notion of &ldquo;emperor&rdquo;, which is a misnomer of this piano concerto, which was dedicated to his patron Archduke Rudolf. However, he was by no means the emperor of his life around the time he composed this concerto, or most of the time in his life, when Vienna, his city, was under siege by Napoleon&rsquo;s armies and Rudolf left him in a cellar.</p>
<p>However, &ldquo;the Emperor&rdquo; was composed during Beethoven&rsquo;s heroic period, and the opening three sonorous chords played by the tutti seem to confirm the sublimeness, leading to an unusually early cadenza. The strings and percussions continue the expression of affirmative and heroic emotions in the orchestra&rsquo;s exposition and mostly throughout the first movement. But, as if he wanted to demonstrate the environment around him, as he put it &ldquo;nothing but drums, cannons, men, misery of all sorts&rdquo;, and to express his desire for inner peace, we also can hear some soft, serene melodies played by woodwinds and the soloist. The contrast in emotions is powerful, and more importantly, the transition between heroic and serene is super smooth: he uses woodwinds as the bridge between the affirmative strings and the piano, then the piano takes the woodwinds&rsquo; turn and plays some affirmative chords with higher dynamic, after that it decrescendos and finally transitions to one of the softest and the most beautiful melodies I&rsquo;ve heard. The woodwinds or the horns then pick up the soloist by accompanying his remaining chords and send us back to the heroic theme played by the strings. Therefore, the soloist has to show contrasting emotions with a convincing transition.</p>
<p>The second movement has a more consistent mood, as the piano and the tutti are either played together or extending the expressions just played by the other. I feel like some melodies in this movement have appeared in many war movies at the part when the war is over and people come back to their destructed home. If the directors of those films are understanding the movement &ldquo;correctly&rdquo;, then the subsequent 3rd movement (like Beethoven&rsquo;s 5th Symphony, the last movement begins without pause) is for sure a lively and happily welcoming-back party for Rudolf. In addition to the relatively shorter time of the last two movements compared to the 20ish minutes of the first movement, another reason for Beethoven to coalesce the two movements is to maybe offer a contrast in mood. As John O’Conor, the soloist, said: &ldquo;There are few people who know that Beethoven has a sense of humor. In the 2nd movement, he despairs in the cellar, and soon he portrays peasants dancing as if they are busy preparing for Rudolf&rsquo;s return. &quot;</p>

      <description>Isle of the Dead, Suite from the opera Háry János, Concerto in D Major for Violin and Orchestra, Op. 61</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="concert-overview">Concert Overview</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.allsenmusic.com/NOTES/2122/6.Mar22.html">March 13th, 2:30 pm at Overture Center</a></p>
<p>The concert&rsquo;s program consists of three pieces: it starts with Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s <em>Isle of the Dead</em>, then it continues with Kodály&rsquo;s <em>Suite from the opera Háry János</em>, and it ends with Ludwig Beethoven&rsquo;s violin concerto <em>Concerto in D Major for Violin and Orchestra, Op. 61</em> after the intermission.</p>
<h2 id="isle-of-the-dead">Isle of the Dead</h2>
<p>If Beethoven&rsquo;s concerto is the main course that features the highly anticipated performance from the violin virtuoso Gil Shaham, then Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s symphonic poem <em>Isle of the Dead</em> is the direct opposite to the relaxing apéritif that should bring us a trifle tipsiness. Instead, it is solemn, sober, and requires the audience&rsquo;s full energy to feel the approach of death and then decide to fight or accept it. The opening 5/8 asymmetrical meter portrays Charon(boatman of the underworld) rowing the boat on the Styx River with thick and oily water towards the island of the dead &ndash; this piece is inspired by Böcklin&rsquo;s painting &ldquo;Isle of the Dead&rdquo; which portrays the same event. The 2 strokes on the left and 3 on the right (later the reverse) are gentle, rhythmic, and hypnotic, intending to soothe the passenger and bringing the near-dead to sleep. Also, Rachmaninoff used this unusual meter to incorporate some Russian elements into this piece, as Russian folk songs often use the 5 meter instead of the more &ldquo;regular&rdquo; ones. As the boat is going forward, the seemingly incessant rowing tune represented by lower strings and brass disappears and is replaced by the gentle slow upper string and woodwind sound [5:27], as if the soul is awakened now as the boat is approaching the island. This passage expresses the reluctance to part with life; [7:07] as the boat keeps moving the emotion is evolved into uneasiness as if the soul now can see the brink of the island. Just as to confirm that, the rowing tune starts again since there is no stop for Charon  [8:56]. The rowing tune builds up tension as if the boat is pulling onto the shore and the brass instruments increase their dynamics that result in the climax, the signal of the boat crashing onto the docking area [9:55]. The first section concludes when the brass recedes and the sound of the gentle yet weak soul represented by strings and woodwinds appears and gradually disappears.</p>
<p>The middle section starts with dour brass [11:11], indicating the &ldquo;welcoming&rdquo; message from the island. Then it transitions to an extremely beautiful melody played by the strings [11:40]. This passage portrays the longing for the dead from the alive. In one version of the painting, the version that inspired this piece, Böcklin was commissioned by Marie Berna to add the female figure and the coffin to the painting, to express Marie&rsquo;s longing for her dead husband. I think Rachmaninoff fuses this longing into this fragment of the piece. However, they are not allowed a lengthy farewell (Charon is busy). The upper string melody is later joined by bass string and brass, and the tempo keeps increasing (tension!), and finally is consumed by brass and three clashes of cymbals [14:42]. The near-dead is now taken away. From [15:06] to [15:51], the repeated &ldquo;long-short-short-short-long&rdquo; rhythmic pattern is played by brass, increasing in pitch and dynamic, and imitated by upper strings, as if the personnel (played by brass) at the island is &ldquo;accompanying&rdquo; the dead (played by upper strings) to climb up the stairs, and as they go higher and higher, the pitch and dynamic become higher and higher. [15:52]The tension continues to build as the upper strings change to a different 4-note melody that sounds like screaming as if the near-dead realizes what is imminent when he looks down the hill. He/she wants to break free from the &ldquo;accompanying&rdquo; personnel, but it is impossible as the string melody is tightly gripped by the accompanying brass and yet again conquered, vanquished, consumed by the brass and cymbals [16:17]. The brass triumphs, and laughs rather evilly (represented by the 4 notes) [16:30].</p>
<p>Finally, the near-dead achieves death when the final section begins with <em>Dies Irae</em> [16:37]. The 4-note melody is repeated again and again in woodwinds just like the death is hypnotizing the dead. [17:18]Suddenly, the fast-paced 4-note <em>Dies Irae</em> played by the shiveringly tremoloed string is fast approaching to give the dead the final blow, and then it resolves to a peaceful woodwind melody to relieve the struggle of the dead. After a brief orchestral mourning of the dead, the 5/8 rowing tune reappears [19:10] &ndash; Charon is setting out for another duty, another business in his perspective. The appearance and the return of the tune embody the cycle of the leave and return to the island.</p>
<p>Charon is the action (he rows people to death) and the concept/subject itself. The requirement of becoming a concept is objectivity. For example, &ldquo;love&rdquo; in &ldquo;Alice loves Bob&rdquo; is not a concept but an action, but &ldquo;love&rdquo; without Alice and Bob is a concept. His objectivity, emotionlessness, and fairness make him the perfect symbol of death. Maybe in his early career, he wants to know, but over time, he has become the concept itself, senseless and careless of who is on the boat. To do that, he has to immerse himself into the cycle and repeat it many times so that he could forget which iteration of the cycle he is currently in (to get a feeling of what it likes or what takes to be Charon, you could play the Isle of the Island in loop).</p>
<h3 id="note-and-some-final-thoughts">Note and some final thoughts</h3>
<p>Like many pieces composed during the Romantic period, <em>Isle of the Dead</em> is program music. Moreover, it is a symphonic poem that uses a single continuous movement to illustrate an idea. The narrative is not as explicit as that of Kodály&rsquo;s <em>Suite from the opera Háry János</em>, but it can be to some extent deduced, interpreted, and reconstructed, under the title of this piece and Böcklin&rsquo;s painting. This piece tries to explore the ultimate unknown of the human being, namely, the passage between life and death. My attempt at understanding this piece starts with the <em>emotion</em> evoked by the melody, variation, repetition, or progressions of the tone colors, dynamics, pace, and pitch, then tries to fill in the imagined <em>narrative</em> that evokes the same emotion. Therefore, it is an attempt of me to construct a mapping from the orchestral effort to the narrative (just as if it is narrated in a poem).</p>
<p>The timeline is constructed under a recording from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VtNWf-kAJM&amp;ab_channel=olla-vogala">Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. 
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>
</p>
<p>Therefore, the exact timestamps vary by different recordings. Also, like there exist different versions of recordings, interpretation of the piece varies. Similarly, this piece is Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s interpretation of Böcklin&rsquo;s painting. Although this piece was inspired by the painting, it is self-contained and it represents his understanding of the subject, death. Equivalently, this piece inspired me to ponder over this subject. Moreover, just as Rachmaninoff was &ldquo;haunted&rdquo; by death &ndash; he composed several pieces that contain the &ldquo;Dies Irae&rdquo; chant over the years, I am sure my interpretation will change as I relisten to this piece in the future. This neverending and eternal momentum that inspires changes is one of the best qualities of the best arts, which makes it timeless.</p>
<h2 id="suite-from-the-opera-háry-jános">Suite from the opera Háry János</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, it is the orchestra version of the opera Háry János, so it is a highly &ldquo;programmed&rdquo; set of pieces that follow closely with the plot and the emotion of the characters. The story is of an Austrian peasant and veteran who sits in the village inn telling fantastic tales of him winning the heart of Marie Louise, the wife of Napoleon, and singlehandedly defeating Napolean and his armies.</p>
<p>I would imagine that anyone who has watched the opera or know the story could understand and fill in the plot while listening to this suite. For example, in the fourth movement, the story goes that Napoleon orders the troops to attack, but eventually kneels down and begs for mercy and his wife&rsquo;s heart. All these can be heard through the solo saxophone that personifies Napoleon. The soloist sat through the first 3 movements (with the mask on), but in the 4th movement, he started playing a melancholy tune, signaling Napolean&rsquo;s remorse over the loss of his wife&rsquo;s heart to the antagonist. Another very Hungarian and narrative-related sound is called an orchestral &ldquo;musical sneeze&rdquo;, which starts the suite off, as best explained in Kodály&rsquo;s own words: &ldquo;According to Hungarian superstition, if a statement is followed by a sneeze of one of the hearers, it is regarded as confirmation of its truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This suite also makes use of one of the Hungarian&rsquo;s traditional instruments, the cimbalom, which uses a pair of hammers to strike the strings to make sounds. The tone color is very unique. In the 3rd movement, the tones played by the cimbalom remind me of Guzheng, a Chinese plucked string instrument. In the intermezzo movement, my favorite movement, which is light and mellow since it is the intermission between the victory over Napolean and the final commendation by the emperor in his palace, its tone color is close to a harpsichord. I am amazed that in Madison Symphony Orchestra they have that instrument and have someone who knows how to play it.</p>
<p>We know that Háry János is a bragger, but somehow we do not feel like laughing at him but sympathizing with him. It again can be best summed up in Kodály&rsquo;s own words: &ldquo;Every Hungarian is a dreamer. He flees from the sad reality of the centuries&hellip;into the world of illusions. Yet Háry János&rsquo;s boasting is more than a dream: it is also poetry. The authors of heroic tales are themselves no heroes, but they are the spiritual kin of heroes. Háry János may never have done the deeds he talks about, but the potential is always there. János is a primitive poet, and what he has to say he concentrates on a single hero: himself. After we have listened to the heroic feats he has dreamed up, it is tragically symbolic that we see him in a grubby village inn. He appears happy in his poverty: a king in the kingdom of his dreams.&rdquo; We can hear the underlying melancholy in the intermezzo, to some degree disguised by the happiness, because we know it is not true happiness and the music wants to covertly show us that as well. Another more explicit representation of the sadness is in the 3rd movement, the &ldquo;Song&rdquo;, a slow, melancholy movement that is about Háry and his fiancée Orsze&rsquo;s longing for home and their wish for a little cottage when they return. We no longer know whether this is still bragging or reality.</p>
<h2 id="concerto-in-d-major-for-violin-and-orchestra-op-61">Concerto in D Major for Violin and Orchestra, Op. 61</h2>
<p>Contrary to the pieces played before the intermission, the &ldquo;main course&rdquo; is not program music, so there exist infinitely many possibilities. For now, it still requires more listening to come up with my analysis. I&rsquo;ve heard one soloist say that while playing this concerto he feels like he is a little bird crossing the vast sea that is portrayed by the orchestra. This interpretation indeed reveals one characteristic of this piece &ndash; the equality and the balance between the soloist and the remaining orchestra, which is shown for example in the first part of the first movement, where the orchestra plays the main melody and the soloist sometimes accompanies the orchestra the other time plays his notes in juxtaposition to the main melody. This balance was uncommon in Beethoven&rsquo;s time when audiences and soloists expected to see/hear and play some flamboyant showmanship. It is not surprising that Franz Clement, to whom this piece was dedicated, did not prepare at all for the premier, inserted his sonatas while playing, and onetime during the play held the violin upside-down, and the reviews were not favorable. I am not sure how this act related to the subsequent facts such as Beethoven only composed one violin concerto (another &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; set forth by Beethoven followed by Tchaikovsky and Brahms, etc.) and he later explicitly wrote out notes for cadenzas in concertos (e.g. Beethoven&rsquo;s 5th piano concerto).</p>
<p>But this is not to say that the virtuosity of the soloist is not manifested at all. Although I am not familiar with the violin techniques and therefore cannot assess the difficulty of playing solo, there are a lot of high trills but none of them played by Gil Shaman, the soloist, is harsh. His smiles when he was not playing convey the utter happiness of the &ldquo;bird&rdquo;.</p>

      <description>I will discuss internet censoring techniques, what types of information are censored specifically in China, and ethical concerns regarding internet censorship in China.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Internet, the network of networks, has long been regarded as the borderless utopian world where people across the world can communicate and share anything they want. This vision is reinforced by the continual growth of the internet powered by advances in both hardware and software. However, as the report shows, the future of the global network may be shaped by regional differences [1]. One notable difference is how different governments censor online information. In this report, I will discuss internet censoring techniques, what types of information are censored specifically in China, and ethical concerns regarding internet censorship in China.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="online_censorship.png" alt="online-censorship"  />
</p>
<p><em><em>Internet censorship 2020: [2]</em></em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Censorship is where an entity in a position of power - such as a government, organization, or individual - suppresses communication that it considers objectionable, harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect, or inconvenient [3]. If someone is censored, she could be suppressed in either accessing or publishing certain information or both. In the context of the internet, censorship is composed of three elements [4]: prescription, identification, and interference. In the section below that discusses internet censorship techniques, I will list more details on how those elements are implemented.</p>
<p>The Great Firewall of China, the internet version of the Great Wall that censors both domestic and international internet traffic, is extremely controversial. Ever since China was connected to the Internet, the Chinese government realized its potential and attempted to control the internet [5]. Over the years, we have seen events that scream censorship led by the government: Google’s eventual retreat after years of attempts to reach a mutual agreement with the government regarding censorship [6], the block of YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, etc. [7], the internet shutdown during the Uyghur protest [8], and many others. In a later section, I will discuss the patterns behind censorship and the related ethical issues in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="technical-background">Technical background</h2>
<p>The three elements, prescription, identification, and interference, serve as a three-step process to accomplish the censorship goal. Censors determine what to censor during the prescription stage. Identification is the process to identify traffics to be censored based on the prescribed results. Finally, censors implement ways to block or impair access to those identified connections and traffics.</p>
<p>The prescription process can be either static or dynamic or both [9]. The static approach uses a blocklist to maintain a list of elements to be blocked. There are three types of blocklist elements [4]: keyword, domain name, and IP address. The prescription may happen in real-time as well. During traffic bursts, the censors may use web crawling, machine learning, or even massive human labor to evaluate real-time contents and decide if they should be censored [10].</p>
<p>The last two steps, identification and interference, can happen at all levels of the network hierarchy where the internet traffics is transmitted. I will call points controlled by the censors in the network hierarchy as points of control, which include but are not limited to: the Internet backbone [11], internet service providers, content distribution networks, and service providers (e.g., search engines, video hosting services, online forums, etc.). After identifying the points of control, the censors can install identification and interference hardware to perform the last two steps.</p>
<p>Censors can identify prescribed elements in either the application layer or the transportation layer or both (they often use both to get more accurate results). <strong>At the application layer</strong>, the most straightforward way to identify blocklist elements is by looking at the HTTP request/response header. The header contains a list of useful information such as the domain name of the requested service under the “host” field. In this way, the censors can block or impair traffics with the hosts in the blocklist [12]. Another related method is URL filtering. A more expensive and intrusive way for identification is called Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). DPI reassembles network flows to examine the application &ldquo;data&rdquo; section, as opposed to only headers, and is therefore often used for identifying prescribed keywords [13]. DPI is also used in blocking Tor in China [14]. <strong>At the transport layer</strong>, the transport header contains the source IP address and destination IP address that can be used to identify the prescribed IPs. The port number along with properties of payload data and flow behavior can be used to identify the protocol used [15], to detect and block traffics generated using circumvention tools. China uses this protocol identification to block Tor [12]. Furthermore, internal identification where content providers identify keywords within their services can be also deployed. A commonly used method of instrumenting content distributors/providers consists of keyword identification to detect restricted terms on their platform. The distributors are willing to comply either due to pressure from the government or incentives from the government or both.</p>
<p>After prescribing and identifying elements, the next step is to interfere with those elements by blocking or impairing them. <strong>At the application layer</strong>, the most commonplace point censors use to interfere is at Domain Name System (DNS). When users enter a domain name to access the website, the browser iteratively asks DNS servers about the IP address associated with the domain to request contents from the website. If the domain name is in the blocklist, determined in the prescription and identification phase, the censor will interfere with the translation process (from domain name to IP address). There are many ways that censors can use to block access to content by altering responses from the DNS, including blocking the response, replying with an error message, or responding with an incorrect address [4][16]. The most prominent technique is DNS cache poisoning. To increase the “translation” performance, DNS servers usually cache the translations for future uses. However, if the DNS servers controlled by the censor respond more quickly than the authoritative DNS resolver with a fake IP address, then the fake address will be cached in all downstream DNS resolvers, which will affect all computers that use those resolvers. <strong>At the transport layer</strong>, packet dropping is a simple way to block any connection with certain prescribed elements. For example, China once dropped all packets to GitHub (the destination IP belongs to GitHub) [17]. If the connection has already been established, the censor can inject RST packets to both sides of the connection that signify the session has been terminated.</p>
<p>Other interfering techniques include Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), network shutdown, manual filtering, self-censorship, and server takedown [4]. The DDoS attack uses botnet or other distributed platforms to flood the services to be blocked by sending enormous traffic to the website so that legitimate requests are ignored. The “Great Cannon”, part of the Great Firewall of China, once redirected web visits to attack certain services [18]. The network shutdown and server takedown, as the names suggested, shut down certain services or all services. China shut down the network in the Xinjiang region during unrest in 2009 in an effort to prevent the protests from spreading to other regions [19]. To avoid being held liable by the government, companies are pressured or incentivized to apply self-censorship. Weibo and Google before its retreat agreed to conform to be &ldquo;self-disciplined&rdquo; in order to get the business license to operate in China [20]. Self-discipline involves taking down content that has certain keywords. Manual filtering is more accurate in marking or removing content with certain keywords than automatic filtering using machine learning. China’s army of monitors employs a lot of human laborers to censor the contents [10].</p>
<h2 id="implications-of-the-censorship-in-china">Implications of the censorship in China</h2>
<p>Technologies have implications when they are deployed in the real world. All of the techniques described above can be used to censor child porn, pirate music, or political content. Why the internet censorship is particularly controversial in China, when other countries censor online content to some extent as well? To figure out that question, we need to know what contents are blocked or impaired in China.</p>
<p>According to [10], there are three types of censorship regarding human expression in China: entire websites in [7] such as Facebook, and YouTube; keyword blocking; hand/manual censoring. The first two censorship techniques can be evaded if you really want to express yourself. China has close alternatives to banned websites such as Weibo (vs Twitter), Baidu (vs Google), and WeChat (vs Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram), and people can express themselves on those platforms. The keyword blocking can be evaded easily since netizens in China can outwit automated keyword binding programs by coming up with clever phasing due to the characteristics of the Chinese language. However, none of the evading techniques could pass the third technique, manual censoring. Since the third technique is the most expensive, extensive, and the strictest technique and the first two have little effect on suppressing human expression, [10] argues that measuring what the manual censoring tries to block gives us an idea of what the Chinese government tries to censor. After comparing the contents of censored posts and non-censored posts, [10] concludes that posts with collective potential, porn, and criticisms of the censors are heavily censored. Posts with collective potential refer to posts posted by someone other than the government and have the potential to join people together to express themselves collectively or even generate collective actions such as protests. On the contrary, posts about government policies, and verbal attacks on government and government officials are much less censored, unless they are attacks on censorship itself. For example, posts about people rushing to buy salt after the earthquake and posts about supporting the government’s actions in the Philippine-China island dispute are censored and blocked as they are considered to have collective potential, despite they are innocuous and pro-government. On the other hand, posts about local corruption that do not have collective potential are not censored by the central government (might be censored by the local governments) and might be even encouraged since the central government wants to know the truth and better control the local governments and maintain its stability. [5] uses the word &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo; to refer to the same idea of the collective potential.</p>
<p>In summary, posts/contents that have collective potential or encourage solidarity without the intention of the central government are censored and likely to be blocked, along with porn and criticisms of the censorship. Additionally, foreign services that do not comply with the censorship agreement, keywords that are deemed “harmful” by the government [21], and posts that are blocked by stricter censorships rules made by content providers to avoid liability (government might allow certain posts but companies just ban them outright) are also censored. Now that we have some ideas on what contents will be censored, what are the ethical issues with such decisions that censor those types of information mentioned above?</p>
<h2 id="ethical-arguments">Ethical arguments</h2>
<h3 id="freedom-of-speech">Freedom of speech</h3>
<p>The central ethical issue of censorship is whether it violates freedom of speech. If we interpret freedom of speech to its “extreme” form, namely, everyone shall have the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, through any media of his choice [22], then any kind of censorship violates this right. In reality, it is used with Mill’s harm principle: the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others [23]. In other words, people can seek and express whatever they want only if it does not produce harm to others. As a matter of fact, the constitution of China closely follows Mill’s harm principle. According to Article 35 of the Constitution of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, citizens of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China enjoy the freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession, and of demonstration [24]; according to Article 51, when the citizens of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China exercises freedom and rights, they must not harm the interest of the state, society, people and other citizen’s freedom and rights [27].</p>
<p>If we believe in freedom of speech as a human right using Mill’s harm principle, then the morality of censorship in the case of porn, collective potential, and criticism of censorship is dependent on whether those three things produce harm. If they do not produce any harm, then censoring them is immoral.</p>
<p>Does, the first category of censorship in China, porn produce harm? It is worth noting that porn here refers to producing, disseminating, or selling porn, not watching porn privately. The censoring of child porn in Australia and many other countries can be justified using Mill’s harm principle if we think harm is produced because child porn involves actual sexual abuse or exploitation of children [25]. But can we justify the claim that extends the censorship to the block of all porn on the internet (if porn is put on the internet, it is considered disseminating/selling porn)? To do that, we have to extend the notion of harm beyond explicit harm as there is no explicit harm involved in the production/dissemination/selling of non-child porn:</p>
<ol>
<li>If X is intrinsically morally wrong [25], then X produces harm.</li>
<li>Porn is intrinsically morally wrong.</li>
<li>Porn produces harm (1,2)</li>
<li>If porn produces harm, then it is morally permissible to censor porn.</li>
<li>Censoring porn is morally permissible (3, 4).</li>
</ol>
<p>The 2nd assumption follows because the Chinese government regards porn as &ldquo;spiritual pollution&rdquo; [26] and if anything pollutes the mind or spirit, it can be seen as intrinsically wrong.</p>
<p>The same framework can be applied to the second and third categories of censorship in China: collective potential and criticisms of censorship itself. To simplify things a bit, I would regard the criticisms of censorship as one type of collective potential since it has the potential to gather public expressions such as collective disapproval. To justify the censorship of collective potential, harm must be shown. Does collective potential have explicit harm? Collective actions can be either a peaceful demonstration or protest that is legal under Article 35, or protests that explicitly harm others. Since collective potential only has the potential to be either one of them, it currently does not have explicit harm. Collective potential also cannot be determined to be intrinsically morally wrong due to the same reason. Therefore, an argument against the morality of censoring collective potential can be formed:</p>
<ol>
<li>If collective potential does not produce harm, then censorship of collective potential is morally impermissible as it violated freedom of speech.</li>
<li>Collective potential does not produce harm.</li>
<li>It is not morally permissible to censor collective potential (1,2).</li>
</ol>
<p>If we really want to justify the morality of censoring collective potential, we have to extend the notion of harm one step further: actions that are “very likely” to produce harm are considered harmful in themselves. For example, posts about people rushing to buy salt after an earthquake may very likely lead to collective actions that result in people who are in dire need of salt cannot buy salt, so it is harmful under the newly extended notion of harm. Therefore, it is morally permissible to take down such posts as we are “almost 100% sure” that they will harm others. A problem with such an extension on the definition of harm is that it is naturally under arbitration and ambiguity. The notion of “very likely” is extremely open to interpretation. This ambiguity is exacerbated by the fact that most censorship occurs at the company level under the category of self-censorship. Because there exists little clear guideline on what to censor, companies have to do guesswork themselves. When Google was questioned by the U.S. Congress on whether they have confirmed with the Chinese government on what to censor before actually censoring those contents, Google said they were just following what others did (local companies, Yahoo!, etc.) [5]. Essentially, it was not the government that was censoring, it was Google that made the decisions. Furthermore, the users will do self-censorship before they express themselves if they fear their speech would be considered “very likely” to produce harm. Therefore, the argument against considering “very likely” to cause harm as harm can be formed:</p>
<ol>
<li>If everyone in the world has to perform self-censorship and others might censor your expression based on arbitrary criteria, then the freedom of speech is violated.</li>
<li>It is the case that everyone has to self-censor and the censorship criteria are arbitrary since we do not have standard censorship rules.</li>
<li>The freedom of speech is violated (1,2).</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, we have to reject the arbitration in determining the harm of some actions. As a result, it is not morally permissible to censor collective potential.</p>

<p>It is not entirely true that foreign services such as Google, YouTube, and Wikipedia are blocked altogether. Circumvention tools such as Virtual Private Network (VPN) still exist and are functional, although VPN service providers are often engaged in the “cat and mouse” game with the government as using VPN is not illegal while providing VPN to the public is illegal. As a result, elites with the knowledge and money to use VPN, elite universities, foreigners, and foreign companies do have the access to the “whole” internet, although with some costs and some hassles such as the need to change VPN providers from time to time. On the other hand, people without such capabilities do not have access to part of the services on the internet. If we define internet access as access to the internet infrastructure and web services on top of that and internet access is one of the human rights, then most Chinese people’s right to access the internet is violated.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The report first discusses general techniques to perform censorship. Then it focuses on China to discuss the implications of using censorship techniques. Specifically, the report shows what the government really tries to censor and block: information with collective potential, porn, and critics of the censorship. Finally, the report discusses the ethical issues of the censorship performed in China around violation of freedom of speech and violation of internet access as a human right.</p>
<p>Since censorship in itself is not intrinsically wrong, as we have shown in discussing the censorship of child porn. However, the only way to justify censoring collective potential is to treat information that is “very likely” to cause harm as real harm, leading to the problem of arbitration and self-censorship. To resolve that, we can either stop censoring collective potential or define “very-likely” in clear, transparent, and standardized ways.</p>

      <description>What happened in the 2nd half of the 2005 Champions League final, compared to the 1st half? This post uses R to expose details that the highlights and/or the match itself ignored.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>On May 25th 2005, the 2005 UEFA Champions league final took place at the
Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. 65000 audiences at the stadium and
hundreds of millions of fans worldwide were about to witness a soccer
game that would be later called the <strong>Miracle of Istanbul</strong>. The
full-of-talent team AC Milan first took the lead within the first minute
by their captain Maldini. They further scored two more goals before
half-time, making it a 3-0 lead. Rumors said that the Milan team opened
bottles of champagnes in the locker room during the half-time break to
celebrate their soon-to-be 2nd champions league title in three years.
However, in the second half Liverpool launched a comeback and scored 3
goals in a dramatic six-minute spell to level the score at 3–3, and beat
Milan 3-2 in the brutal penalty shoot-out stage. The English commentator
said:“If this doesn’t prove fate exists, then nothing will” at the end
of the game. To be sure, this epic comeback defies any words that try to
describe it, but I will try to use visualizations to do this job and
more importantly, try to figure out how the comeback happened.</p>
<h3 id="the-underdog">The underdog</h3>
<p>The Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard described his team as the underdog
before the match, compared to the all-star Milan side, and he was right.
According to data from the transfermarkt.co.uk,</p>

we can see that the market value of Milan’s starting XI is significantly
higher than Liverpool’s. Individually, Milan’s players took 8 places out
of the top 10 highest market value players of the joint teams. The
captain Steven Gerrard and the striker Baros are the 2 exceptions for
Liverpool.</p>
<p>After setting the stage, let us go to the actual match.</p>
<h2 id="the-data">The Data</h2>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The dataset comes from the open-source github repository of the soccer
data analytic company <em>statsbomb</em>. They make public 878 datasets in JSON
format, one per game, including this one. Every dataset contains
thousands of events, each event is characterized by about 100 or more
variables that describe the event.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">dim</span>(istanbul)

<p>The dataset that records events about the miracle of Istanbul has 4648
events, each is described by 126 variables.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">head</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">colnames</span>(istanbul), n <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><pre><code>##  [1] &quot;id&quot;             &quot;index&quot;          &quot;period&quot;         &quot;timestamp&quot;     
##  [5] &quot;minute&quot;         &quot;second&quot;         &quot;possession&quot;     &quot;duration&quot;      
##  [9] &quot;related_events&quot; &quot;location&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The above shows the first 10 variables. The first variable <code>id</code> is the
unique identifier of each event; <code>period</code> denotes which time period this
event occurs (eg. 1 = the first half); <code>timestamp</code> records the exact
time of each event; <code>location</code> is another important variable that
records the coordinate information of the event. An example event
therefore would be: player x at time 00:31:52.716 passes the ball at the
pitch coordinate (24, 40) at mid-height with angle y…. As I go forward, we
will use and visualize more interesting variables.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics-of-the-data">Characteristics of the data</h3>
<ul>
<li>The dataset is really sparse (lots of NULL or NA values). This makes
sense, because at one time point only one player is able to make one
action. For example, Variable <code>dribble_nutmeg</code> is not NA if and only
if some player nutmugs someone else (ouch!).</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">length</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">which</span>(<span style="color:#f92672">!</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">is.na</span>(istanbul<span style="color:#f92672">$</span>dribble.nutmeg)))
</span></span></code></pre></div><pre><code>## [1] 4
</code></pre>
<p>4 nutmegs in 120 minutes (90 mins regular time plus 30 mins extra), not
bad!</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to take special care of the <code>location</code> variable. The
<code>location</code> denotes the pitch coordinates of each event. The
coordinate is standardized as dimension 120 * 80. However, soccer
pitch size varies and the Atatürk Olympic Stadium has dimension 105
meters * 68 meters. We need to scale the coordinate from the
relative location to the actual meters, so that the event will show
up on the correct location on the pitch I draw.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>To summarize the timeline that we see above. In the first half, Milan
scored immediately when the game began, and scored two more goals
towards the end of the first half. On the other hand, Liverpool made a
substitute because of injury. Before the start of the 2nd half,
Liverpool was already 3-0 down and used one (out of total 3)
substitution involuntarily. At the beginning of the 2nd half, Liverpool
made yet another substitution. This substitution is due to the tactical
consideration by the Liverpool manager, trying to turn things around,
and it did. About 10 minutes later, Liverpool score their first goal,
making it 3-1, and in this 6 minutes spell, they score three goals in
total, levelling the score to 3-3. Both teams did not score in the later
parts of the game, and Liverpool beat Milan 3-2 in Penalty shootout (the
red X denotes penalty missing or being saved by the goalkeeper).</p>
<p>By seeing this timeline plot, all the key events are laid out clearly.
Furthermore, we can immediately gain insights towards our question,
which is, how the miracle happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>The three comeback goals were scored in 6 minutes! What happened in
those 6 minutes?</li>
<li>The distribution of goals are quite “even”, in that Milan scored 3
in the first half and Liverpool scored 3 in the second half. Why
that is the case?</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing that stands out from the timeline graph is that there were
only 2 yellow cards (all from Liverpool) and 0 red card in the game.
That is extremely rare for a soccer game, especially for the Champions
League final, the biggest game of the year. It shows how both teams were
focusing on playing the game actively, not on playing the game passively
(by fouling a lot to stop the other team’s play). It is truly a smooth
and high quality game, and dramatic.</p>
<h2 id="heaven-or-hell">Heaven or Hell</h2>
<p>As the timeline suggested, we see a distinction between the 1st half and
the 2nd half. Each team scored three goals and the other team scored
nothing. Specifically, the 1st half is the heaven for Milan, the hell
for Liverpool; the 2nd half is exactly the reverse of the 1st half. Can
we visualize the difference, the difference between heaven and hell?</p>

</p>
<p>As we can see, in the 1st half, Milan made 8 shots (8 dots on the pic
above) and Liverpool made 5. However, most of the shots by Milan (6 out
of 8) were inside the box, whereas Liverpool only had 2.</p>

In the 2nd half, we’d expect that Liverpool dominates the shots and
shots in the box. On the contrary, Milan still dominates the number of
shots and shots in the box. Liverpool made only 2 shots inside the box
and they all made it into the net, and Liverpool also scored a
long-ranger. However, Milan attempted 6 shots inside the box and 6 more
outside the box, none of them made it.</p>
<p>Let’s see the comparison between shots made by both teams in the extra
time.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span style="display:flex;"><span>is <span style="color:#f92672">%&gt;%</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img loading="lazy" src="unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" alt=""  />

Surprisingly (or not so surprisingly after seeing the shots made in the
2nd half of the game), Liverpool made no attempts and Milan made 7 more
shots, 3 of them inside the box with 1 near the post of the goal (so
close!) and yet, Milan scored nothing.</p>
<h3 id="passes">Passes</h3>
<p>Passes are a essential part of a soccer game. By looking at the
locations of the passes (both the starting locations and the end
locations), we can also see the positions of the ball and the players.</p>

<p>We break the 1st half into two halves. The <strong>picture 1</strong> shows the
passing map of AC Milan in the first 24 minutes, with Pirlo being the
center of the passing map (the biggest blue dot in the map), Milan’s
transition (from attack to defense and vice versa) depended on him.
Another thing to notice is that one of the Milan’s forward, Crespo, was
not really involved in the game. The <strong>picture 2</strong> is the passing map
of Milan in the second half of the 1st half. Compared to the first
picture, Milan’s formation retrieved to their goal. For example, in the
first 24 minutes, Maldini (left back), Gattuso, Seedorf, were standing
in front of the Pirlo; they were behind Pirlo in the later half of the
1st half. I would guess the reason was due to the increase in
aggressiveness of Liverpool, as well as their own strategy of
contracting their defensive lines and playing counterattack, since they
led 1-0 as early as 1 minute into the game. And that strategy was
fantastic! They scored two more goals on counter attack at 39’ and 44’
when Liverpool tried really hard attacking (since they were 1-0 behind).
The scorer of both goals is Crespo, the man who were not “involved” in
terms of passing in the first 24 minutes, and he became lethal in the
second part.</p>
<p>The <strong>picture 3 and 4</strong> tell the Liverpool’s part of the story
in the 1st half. The first thing to notice is that Kewell was out and
Smicer was in for him (Kewell was in the 3rd pic but not in the 4th, and
Smicer the opposite) because Kewell was injured. And compared the 4th
with the 3rd picture, Gerrard and Sanz were pushing forward and to the
center, while the two wingers Riise and Smicer were roughly in the same
position as before.</p>

<p>We have seen the hell for Liverpool, i.e., the first half of the game,
where Milan scored an early goal and player on counter and scored two
more goals while Liverpool was struggling in attacking. However, as the
timeline suggests, in the second half of the game, there was a 6-minute
spell where Liverpool scored 3 goals. That spell was really the heaven
for Liverpool and for Liverpool’s fans. What happened? Since we are in
the passing section and analyzing passes are really effective in
analyzing the whole game, let’s look at all the passes happened in that
spell. In the <strong>picture 1</strong>, Milan achieved 27 passes with less than
60% of them completed. Only 8 players of Milan were involved in passing
the ball one or more times. Looking more closely, the <strong>picture 2</strong>
indicated that the passes from defense to midfield and midfield to
attack all failed (red: failure, blue: success).</p>
<p>On the contrary, the <strong>picture 3</strong> shows that all 10 players
(excluding the goalkeeper) were involved in passing, and they achieved
more than 75% passing accuracy. The <strong>picture 4</strong> shows the exact
passes.</p>
<p>In the 1st half, the passing accuracy was 78% for Milan. What causes
this decline in passing accuracy and number of passes on the Milan side,
whereas Liverpool somehow maintained their passing accuracy? I then look
at the defensive acts by both teams in that six minutes.</p>

<p>The <strong>picture 1</strong> is the defensive actions done by Liverpool players
in 6 minutes. What is staggering is that they managed to achieve 7 ball
retrievals, leading to the decline in Milan’s passing accuracy. The
<strong>picture 2</strong> shows the defensive actions done by Milan. The mere 1
ball retrieve hardly influenced Liverpool’s passing and possession.</p>
<h3 id="position">Position</h3>
<p>We have seen some visual information about the position of the players
in the passing maps earlier, to the point that we saw some deliberate
position shifts from the Milan side in the 1st half when they contracted
their defense lines. Through the viualizations below, we can see more
about the shifts in positions in terms of the whole team (i.e. shifts in
team formation) and individual key players.</p>

<p>The <strong>picture 1</strong> is the average position of the Milan in the 1st
half. The average position is defined as the average coordinates of
players when they take any actions, not only the passing ones. As we can
see, the Milan’s formation were really tight in the center of the
midfield. In addition to the 4 midfielders, one of the forwards Crespo
was close to midfield as well. And they were close together in the
center for a reason (as explained below).</p>
<p>In the <strong>picture 2</strong>, Liverpool’s formation in the 1st half was rather
scattered acrossthe width of the field. This was due to their tactics of
playing wide on the sides. Gerrard and Olano were together as a pair,
sitting in the midfield. However, their attacks on the sides were not
going very well, so Milan decided not to put too many players on the
sides (indicated by the 1st pic) and focused their attacks and later
their counter attacks in the center.</p>

<p>With 3-0 down, Liverpool took right back Finnan down (therefore
forfeiting the attacking on the sides tactics) and put Hamman up
immediately in the beginning of the 2nd half, and the result was
astonishing! In the <strong>picture 2</strong>, Hamann took the position of where
Gerrard was in the 1st half, and freed Gerrard. By sacrificing the right
back, the Liverpool squeezed their formation towards the center.
Gerrard, together with Sanz and Baros, were constantly charging to the
Milan’s box carefree, since Hamann took care of his defensive duties.
And Boom! Gerrard scored the first goal, a header inside the box, and
created a penalty (later converted to the 3rd goal).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Some may say that there is no need to visualize a soccer match, since it
is a visual art/sport in itself. I have to agree since I am a soccer fan
and have had so much joy and pain watching the games. It is especially
hard to try to visualize a miracle. However, I did it anyway because an
EDA process on a soccer match dataset can achieve the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A visual summary. In normal games, audiences see the motions of
players in terms of motions of pictures, and they do not have good
enough memory to remember everything and do not have time to
summarize those information, as they are concentrated on the game
itself. After the match, audiences will see lots of statistics about
the game, such as the number of shots, the possession rate, number
of passes, pass accuracy, etc, and they do not make much sense and
they are not even comparable. A 65% possession rate in a game by a
side is not the same thing as another team having 65% in another
game. Go ask Barcelona fans. Their team used to have 65% possession
and ended up winning all trophies, and now win nothing with the same
possession rate. Visualizations like this can combine the visual
part with the summary part, providing fans with a more immersive and
insightful perspective towards understanding the game.</li>
<li>A good starting point for models about soccer game. As the advance
of data science, models about soccer games are in dire need. A
prominent example would be the model to predict expected goals given
the data about soccer games. This EDA process is great for:
<ol>
<li>See the data and find the characteristics of the data. In my example, it would be a lot of None values in the dataset and incompatible field dimension that I need to manually change.</li>
<li>Visualize the key events that may lead to goals.</li>
<li>Find out directions that may worth pursuing. I find out the 6 minute Liverpool spell and think this may be the direction to look further into.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Main lessons learnt: It is no doubt a miracle, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Super dramatic. Liverpool dominated the game for only 6 minutes, and
ended up scoring three goals. Milan took the show for 114 minutes,
including 7 shots in extra time, and they failed to score any after the 1st
half. The inefficiency in shooting influenced their mindset in the final
penality shoot out, missing 3 out of 5. And Dudek’s (Liverpool’s
goalkeeper) double save from Shevchenko in the 117th minute was
voted the greatest Champions League moment of all time.</li>
<li>Some reasons behind the comeback drama. 6 minutes spell because of
the introduce of Hamann that freed Gerrard to attack. Milan’s
success in the 1st half was also due to the formation factor, where
Milan was tight in the center and Liverpool scattered.</li>
<li>Human factor. The hard part to visualize. The psychological change
of the Milan side as they went from ecstasy to doubt, and to fear.
Their change in mindset when they repeatedly attack but scored
nothing. On the other side, Gerrard and his influence on the
whole team.</li>
