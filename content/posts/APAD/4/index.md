They take aesthetics to be the study of that dimension of human experience anchored at the positive end by feelings that would elicit verbal expressions such as, “Oh wow! That’s great! I love it!” and at the negative end by “Ugh! That’s awful! I hate it!” The definition of aesthetics is hard to be grounded in the external world: 
- it is hard to find an “exemplar” object that induces positive aesthetic response to all individuals. 

Everyone has some sort of aesthetic response to everything he or she (consciously) encounters. 

Giving the definition and assumption they make, they bring up and address two principal questions about human aesthetic experience as concrete, well-defined empirical problems that can be approached using the standard tools of scientific research:
- How are aesthetic responses related to stimulus dimensions
- what causes people to have them in the first place (why people have them)

by formulating hypotheses about how the visual system works and/or why it works that way, doing experiments designed to test these hypotheses, interpreting the results in light of them, and formulating further hypotheses to be tested in the next iteration of an ongoing hypothesis-testing cycle.

The domains they have been studying: aesthetic preferences for color and spatial composition. Though they are distinct aspects of vision that diverge within the visual nervous system right in the retina and appear to stay separated through much of early cortical processing. They share a surprising high-level commonality in that both are strongly influenced by **implicit statistical knowledge of the observer’s ecological niche**.

## Color Preferences
A century of scientific investigation has taught us a great deal about which colors people like, on average, but there has been surprisingly little work on *why* people like the colors they do.

### Theories of color preference
- Nicholas Humphrey: color preferences (like/dislike) arise because of the different signals (approach/avoid) that colors convey to organisms in nature.
- Hurlbert and Ling’s evolutionary theory: they suggest a neural mechanism for color preferences based on hard-wired, cone-opponent responses (in the first few synapses, at an early stage) that arose from natural selection
- gender differences were found and were attributed to evolutionary adaptation within prehistoric hunter-gather societies
- a variant of this theory: the color preferences arise from a higher-level set of color dimensions. We call this theory the “color appearance theory” simply because its dimensions (hue, brightness, saturation) correspond more closely to people’s conscious experiences of color appearance than the outputs of the cone systems.
- Ou and associates: they studied the emotion/feelings evoked by either colors or color combinations. They proposed 9 emotion-like dimensions, measured people’s responses to colors in terms of these color-emotion dimensions, and performed a factor analysis of these data. 3 stands out tbat explain 67% variance. But, they did not speculate on how color-emotions arise nor why some color-emotions predict preferences better than others.
    - one possible explantion is that people like the color because of the emotion it is associated with.

### EVT 
their theory: Ecological valence theory (EVT): people like colors to the degree that they like the environmental objects that are that color, not to the colors themselves.
- If true, the EVT implies that the human brain contains statistical information about the overall affective valence (liking to disliking) of interactions with colored objects, so that their health and well-being are likely to be improved if they are attracted to things whose colors “look good” to them and avoid things whose colors “look bad” to them. 
    - analogy: taste in food
- they test EVT and compare its predictions for color preferences with the predictions of above theories

Further (a level deeper), the affective valence/knowledge may come from genetically through the evolutionary history of the species; or autobiographically
- human-innate (universal)
    - e.g., blue skies and brown feces
- learning: based on environmental feedback such that an organism comes to like the colors it has found to be associated with advantageous outcomes and vice-versa

#### Human Innate
The best evidence for innate color preferences in humans comes from measurements of looking preferences in infants.
Researchers measure either how much time infants spent looking at each color in comparison with white during a series of fixed-duration trials or the percentage of trials on which infants look first at each color in comparison with white. 
- Teller, Civan, and Bronson-Castain for the first-look preferences of 12-week-old infants viewing pairs of six colors. 

#### Learning 
Through interactions with objects in the environment, people learn valences for particular objects depending on the pleasantness/unpleasantness of their experiences with them. The EVT implies several levels at which environmental factors might influence color preferences: 
1. people across the world should reflect universal trends in colored object valences 
2. cross-cultural differences 
3. systematic sub-cultural influences 
    - univiersity, sports, religion 
4. systematic sub-cultural influences: unique experiences of individuals

Color preferences may change systematically over time on a scale from weeks to years within individuals and from years to centuries within cultures. (dynamic)

EVT could account for all of those factors: universal, cultural, sub-cultural, idiosyncratic, and even dynamic

### research on average color preferences in the united states
They sampled 32 colors over the three most salient dimensions of color appearance: hue, saturation, and brightness. There are 4 cuts that each has 8 colors: they first chose 
- 8 hues with the highest saturation that could be produced on their monitors (4 primaries and 4 binary hues) and include them in the *s* cut
- another 8 in the "muted" cut were those about halfway between the *s* color and neutral gray
- the “light” (l) cut were those about halfway between each *s* color and white
- those in the “dark” (d) cut were those about halfway between each *s* cut and black.
They also included five achromatic colors—white, black, and the three grays whose luminance was the average luminance of the eight hues in the l, m, and d cuts

Experiment 1: They recruited 48 participants with normal color vision participated in 30 different tasks as part of the Berkeley Color Project, including: 
- preference ratings of individual colors
- ratings of color appearance dimensions (red–green, blue–yellow, light–dark, and high–low saturation),
- ratings of the three factor-analytic dimensions of color-emotions (active–passive, heavy–light, and warm–cool)

#### Results
- Average preference ratings showed relatively strong effects of hue in the s, l, and m colors (for which hues are preferred see fig 8.3 in paper)
- s colors were preferred to l and m colors, which did not differ from each other.
- Hue and cut did not interact across the s, l, and m cuts, but they did interact for the d
    - dark-orange (brown) and dark-yellow (olive) were less preferred than other oranges and yellows, whereas dark-red and dark-green were more preferred than other reds and greens.

To explain/fit the model, they used previously described theories to fit multiple regression models on the data they collected: 
- the lower-level cone-contrast theory (37% of the variance) 
- the higher-level color-appearance (60%)
- color-emotion theories (55%)

### weighted affective valence estimates (wave) of colors: test of EVT
This experiment (Experiment 2) was designed to test the principal assumption of the EVT: color preferences should largely be predictable from the average valences of people’s affective reactions to objects with corresponding diagnostic colors. 

Doing so required us to collect data from three different tasks: object associations, object valence ratings, and color–object match ratings.

#### Object Association Task
They collected object associations for each of our 37 colors by showing them to a *separate* group of 74 observers and asking them to describe as many things of that color as they could in 20 seconds. They were asked to describe only things whose colors would be known by most other people from their verbal description. Descriptions came up by participants will be eliminated if they:
- could be any color
- were abstract concepts instead of objects 
- were color names instead of objects
- were very dissimilar to the presented color 
- were provided by only a single participant across all colors.

The remaining descriptions were then categorized to reduce their number. The net result was a list of 222 objects/descriptive categories, each has a color assigned to it. 

#### Object Valence Ratings
The resulting 222 descriptive categories were then shown in black-on-white text to 98 different participants, who were asked to rate the affective value of the referent object (i.e., how positive or negative they felt about it) using the same line-mark rating scale as in Experiment 1. These ratings were averaged over participants, resulting in 222 object valence ratings.

#### Object–Color Match Ratings
a third independent group of 31 participants each of the 222 object descriptions paired with each of the 32 colors for which it had previously been given as a description, one pair at a time. Participants were asked to rate how well the color of the described object category matched the color on the screen using the same line-mark rating scale. The average color–object match ratings were then used to weight the average affective valence rating for each object–color pair, such that the valences of the descriptions that better matched the color on the screen were weighted more heavily. We call this measure the “weighted affective valence estimate” (WAVE) of the color.

#### Result
X: WAVE: $W_{c} = \frac {1}{n_{c}} \sum_{o=1}^{n_{c}} W_{co}v_{o}$
- $n_{c}$: the number of object descriptions ascribed to color c, derived from Object Association Task
- $W_{co}$: the average color-object match value for each pairing of a color and an object description across participants (Object–Color Match Ratings)
- $v_{o}$: the average valence rating given to object o across participants (Object Valence Ratings)

Y: preference ratings of individual colors in experiment 1

The fit of the WAVE to the preference data produces a correlation of +0.89, which accounts for 80% of the variance. The WAVE model only uses a single predictor variable. 

The unweighted average valence ratings (without $W_{co}$) are almost as highly correlated with preferences (r = 0.83) as the WAVEs are.

However, its main deficiencies lie in under-predicting the aversion to dark-orange (largely because chocolate is rated as quite appealing) and under-predicting the positive preference for dark-red (largely because blood is rated as unappealing).
- might be due to exclusion of abstract concept in the object association task
- in addition to be weighted by $W_{co}$, the frequency of the object occurred in participant's environment is also a key factor. For example, chocolate is rated as quite appealing, but feces might be more "available" to participants' impression than cholocate, in terms of the number of people mentioned, or the average rank (smaller rank implies greater availability)

Importantly, although the present evidence is correlational, we find it unlikely that causation runs in the opposite direction, that is: color preferences are *caused* by average affective responses to correspondingly colored objects. Some third mediating variable could conceivably be at work, but it is unclear what that might be.

### Further tests of the EVT
#### Cultural Commonalities and Differences
Prediction: The EVT clearly implies that the WAVE data generated by members of one culture will predict that culture’s color preferences better than it will predict another culture’s color preferences. NO RESULTS YET.

#### Sub-cultural Differences
Prediction: If people have highly positive (or negative) emotional investments in a social institution that has strong color associations they should come to like the associated colors correspondingly more (or less) than the rest of the population, such that there will be a positive correlation between their liking/disliking of the institution and their liking/disliking of the associated colors.

Results: among students at the University of California, Berkeley, the amount of self-rated school spirit correlates positively with their preference for Berkeley’s blue and gold relative to preference for the cardinal red and white colors of Stanford University, an arch-rival institution. The opposite pattern of results is found at Stanford. 

#### Individual Differences
EVT provides a theoretical framework for accounting for individual color preferences, provided that the WAVEs of colors can be accurately assessed for individuals, by esstially redoing the 3 tasks mentioned in test of EVT:
- each observer make his or her own valence ratings of the “standard” set of objects for his or her culture (the U.S. culture standard set could be the 222 catagories)
    - The crucial test of the EVT for individuals is whether individuals’ personal color preferences are correlated more highly with their own personal WAVEs than other people’s WAVEs. 
- include idiosyncratic colored objects in the analysis

## Spatial Composition

Problem statement: How should the to-be-depicted object(s) be situated within a rectangular frame so that viewers, on average, have the most aesthetically pleasing experience by measuring people’s aesthetic responses to different compositions of the *same* object viewed from the same perspective? (no content issue)
- collect data on behavior rather than relying on somebody's introspection
- average viewers, not (trained) elites
- study simple pictures rather than art objects => more controlled 

### horizontal placement of a single object
#### Participants' Task: a constrained adjustment task
They saw pictures of a single object against a minimal background and were asked to use a computer mouse to drag the object back and forth along the horizontal midline to find the most aesthetically pleasing position. 

Each object was shown in three poses relative to the viewer: facing leftward, facing rightward, and facing forward.

They measured the percentage of trials on which the object’s center fell into each of seven equal-sized horizontal bins.

They also used 2AFC, free-choice photography of everyday objects, and analyses of the positions of objects in single- object stock photographs from a commercial database. All methods show essentially the same effects, with some exceptions.

#### Results
Large, systematic interactions between facing direction and horizontal position are clearly evident. Forward-facing objects were strongly preferred at or very near the center of the frame, whereas left-facing objects were strongly preferred on the right side of the frame, and right-facing objects were strongly preferred on the left side of the frame.
- center-bias: the single most potent structural element of the frame is its center; the center bias does not depend on any particular knowledge about the object, except the location of the object’s own center, which can be computed just from its visually evident contours.
    - Arnheim's The Power of the Center
    - Palmer's own researches
- inward-bias: is object-dependent and knowledge-based because it requires the perceiver to know which side of the object constitutes its front, and this depends on more than just the shape of the object. We don't yet know the reason to it. 
    - high perceptual salience of the features on the fronts of objects? 
    - expected forward motion of objects? 
    - a much greater area in front of an object that is of functional interest to an observer than behind it
    - asymmetries in the functional affordance space, more in front than in back?
