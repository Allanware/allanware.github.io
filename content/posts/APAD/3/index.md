For art’s most expert informants, artistic images don’t only trigger perceptions or cause emotions, the usual subjects of aesthetic science. They also carry content: **semantic**.

## Science and Artistic Expertise
- What count as the salient features and effects of works of art are in fact *determined* by the judgments of experts and elites: the nature of our entire artistic experience trickles down from them. Art is such a peculiar, and peculiarly cultural, phenomenon that there can be no “natural,” untutored set of reactions to art objects, or none at least that are reliably relevant to those objects’ value as art.

- The unique thing about aesthetic science is that it often seems to be both studying how we interpret and elucidate art, and actually engaging in such *interpretation* and *elucidation*. The goal of aesthetic science often seems to be to figure out what a work of art is and why it works and what might make it good—a goal it shares with the art lovers it purports to be studying. **When aesthetic science fails, it’s often because it fails to yield cogent insights into art**. In contrast, the psychology of physics doesn’t fail by failing to predict the orbits of planets.

=> the central role of any professional who analyzes art, whether from a science or humanities perspective, is not merely to determine truths about a set of fixed relationships between viewers and art objects. It is to help viewers relate to art in fertile new ways that have not been available before, or already have been triggered by earlier experts’ ideas.
    - The most useful and powerful claims to make about the Mona Lisa might **not** relate to confirming and fleshing out the old clichés about her supposedly enigmatic smile (see the previous paper). They might, instead, direct viewers’ attention to some completely different, previously unattended aspect of the picture
