## A Bayesian Cognition Approach for Belief Updating of Correlation Judgement through Uncertainty Visualizations
- Alireza Karduni, Douglas Markant, Ryan Wesslen, [Wenwen Dou](https://webpages.charlotte.edu/wdou1/)

### Key Words
correlation perception, correlation judgement, prior belief, Bayesian cognition modeling, uncertainty visualization, belief elicitation

### Contributions
The experiments in this paper build on previous research on correlation judgement by examining the impact of &**prior beliefs** and **uncertainty communication**.

### Background 
#### Correlation Judgement 
- Weber's law: the change in a stimulus that will be just noticeable is a constant ratio of the original stimulus
    - e.g. in weight lifting, the same added weight will be more noticeable if the weight you already carried is relatively small
- dual-process account of reasoning (thinking, fast and slow)

## A Scanner Deeply: Predicting Gaze Heatmaps on Visualizations Using Crowdsourced Eye Movement Data

### Key Words 
CNN, gaze prediction, eyetracking

### Contributions
- a taxonomy on eyetracking methods 
- employ a webcam-based eyetracking approach using task-specific visualizations as the stimulus
- collect a stimulus dataset made of visualization images 
- a virtual eyetracker model that given an image of a visualization generates a gaze heatmap for that image.
