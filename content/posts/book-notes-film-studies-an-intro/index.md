## Overview
- It is a "primer" book on Film studies, as the author Ed Sikov himself called it. Therefore, it introduces a general (sometimes too general) outline of the subject as well as a list of terms frequently seen in the literature. In the end, it should be a book to get someone like me ready for more serious treatises on the subject of film. 

## Introduction 

- Representation: content + form = symbol that communicates meaning. Example: let content = a horse, form = sculpture, so in this case the representation of horse = a horse sculpture. 
- All representations have meaning.  

## Chapter 1: Mise-en-scene: within the image

- **Mise-en-scene**: all of the elements placed in front of the camera to be photographed: settings, props, lighting, costumes, makeup, and figure behavior (meaning actors, their gestures, and their facial expressions). In addition, mise-en-scene includes the camera’s actions and angles and the cinematography. Since film studies assume that everything within the image has expressive meanings, so by analyzing mise-en-scene, we begin to see what those meanings might be.
- Written info vs Visual info: audiences see visual info much quicker than reading the info (about the shot). On the other hand, filmmakers find ways of directing our gaze to specific areas in the image by manipulating compositions, colors, areas of focus, and so on. By examining each of these aspects of cinema, film studies attempt to wake us up to what’s in front of us onscreen—to make us all more conscious of what we’re seeing and why. 
- The sheer amount of expressive information—the content of individual shots, and the relationships from shot to shot—is staggering.
- **Shot**: an uninterrupted run of the camera; the building block of the movies. 
- **Scene**: a section of a motion picture in a single location and continuous time made up of a series of shots which are each a set of contiguous frames. 

### Subject-Camera Distance

The General (maybe too general) rule is that the closer the camera is to the subject, the more emotional weight the subject gains. For example, a close-up of the ringing phone may give significance to the phone call. Exception exists.

- extreme close-up: maybe a shot of part of the object (the eyes, for example)
- close-up: a shot that isolates an object in the image
- medium close-up: maybe from chest up in terms of the human body.
- medium shot: maybe from the waist up
- three-quarter shot: from knees up
- full shot: the entire human body
- long shot: the object and its surroundings
- extreme long shot

Those terms are relative, with different usage for different filmmakers. Also, a close-up is a close-up in relation to something, a body for example, or other objects and landscapes. 

### Camera Angle

- eye-level shot: the camera is placed at the level of the eyes.
- low-angle shot: shoots from below.
- high-angle shot: shoots from above. 
- over-head shot/bird's-eye shot
- dutch tilt/canted angle: camera tilts away horizontally or vertically, instead of facing the subject squarely. 

Typically, directors use low-angle shots to aggrandize their subjects. And high-angle shots, because they look down on the subject, are often used to subtly criticize the subject by making him or her seem slightly diminished, or to distance an audience emotionally from the character. Exception applies. 

### Camera/shot framing

- Two-shot: two people, balanced in the shot (talking, for example)
- Three-shot: three people
- master shot: include the whole set

### Composition

- how the elements on screen (actors, scenery, props, etc.) appear in respect to each other and within the frame itself.
- Mise-en-scene includes all elements and composition is the relationship of the elements within the frame (a concept borrowed from painting). 
- motion pictures are all about motion, so almost every composition is fluid. Moreover, shots are connected to other shots in the editing process, and the composition of one shot ought to have something to do not only with the shot that follows it but with the shot that precedes it.

### Aspect Ratio

- silent film: 4:3
- academy ration: 1.375: 1
- Nowadays, films are made widescreen. 

### Films mentioned

- Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, 1953
  - the director includes the swimming pool "accident" to convey a certain idea.
- Psycho, 1960
  - notice the first shot of the woman to be killed later
- Sunset Boulevard, 1950
- Citizen Kane, 1941
  - an extreme close-up on Kane's lip while saying "rosebud" and another extreme close-up on his mansion.
  - Welles chooses to film his central character in a low-angle shot at precisely the moment of his greatest humiliation by making Kane look clumsy and too big for his surroundings, and therefore more pitiable and pathetic.
- The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928)
- Malcolm X, 1992
  - reel time vs real-time. 3 hr 22 mins show a man's 39 years of life
- Rear Window, 1954
  - look for the composition of the courtyard
- Fight Club, 1999
  - look for the composition of the bar's basement
- Casablanca, 1942
  - look for the composition of the Rick's Café
- Do the Right Thing, 1989
  - look for the composition of the Sal's Pizzeria
