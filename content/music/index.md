## Chamber Music
- Brahms: Piano Quintet in F Minor, Op. 34
- Schubert: Quintet in A Major for Piano and Strings, "the Trout Quintet"
    - this quintet along with its inspiration (Schubert's Lied "Die Forelle") earn him the title (in my heart) "the Prince of Trout". He died at the age of 31, and his music, as Robert Schumann put it, "bears within it the seeds of everlasting youth".
