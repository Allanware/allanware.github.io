# Playlists 
- [Classical Music](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/freiburger-barockorchester-gottfried-von-der-goltz/pl.u-JPAZZK2IJEKZ6X)
    - I took a orchestral music apprecication course, and [this playlist](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/mus-106-symphonic-music/pl.u-V9D77WNsPEbp8q)(a different one from above) contains the pieces we covered in class (it has better structure in terms of music history and musical periods).
    - Each piece in the playlists is only a part of the whole work. For example, I usually just choose one movement out of the four or five movements of the whole symphony. I highly recommend that listeners listen the whole thing to have a more wholistic view. To do that, you could click on the three dots on the right side of each piece, and click on **view in apple music**, which will direct you to the album this piece belongs to.
