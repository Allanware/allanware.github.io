- Rachmaninoff: Symphony No. 2 in E minor
- Bartók: Concerto for Orchestra

## Concerto
- Rachmaninoff: Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor
    - if you are new to classical music, this would be the perfect place to start.
- Rachmaninoff: Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor
    - after listening to No. 2, the first few bars alone of No. 3 could excite me.
- [Beethoven: Piano Concerto No. 5 in E♭ Major]({{< ref "posts/concert-review-2/index.md#piano-concerto-no-5-the-emperor" >}})
- Felix Mendelssohn: Concerto in E minor for Violin and Orchestra
- Beethoven: Violin Concerto in D Major
- Tchaikovsky: Piano Concerto No. 1 in B♭ minor

## Chamber Music
- Brahms: Piano Quintet in F minor, Op. 34
- Schubert: Quintet in A Major for Piano and Strings, "the Trout Quintet"
    - this quintet along with its inspiration (Schubert's Lied "Die Forelle") earn him the title (in my heart) "the Prince of Trout". He died at the age of 31, and his music, as Robert Schumann put it, "bears within it the seeds of everlasting youth".
