      <description>A Paper a Day: The Philosophy of Art and Aesthetics, Psychology, and Neuroscience: studies in literature, music, and visual arts by Noël Carroll, Margaret Moore, and William P. Seeley</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alexander Baumgarten, 1735: Baumgarten used the phrase episteme aisthetike to mean the science of what is sensed and imagined, in contrast to the science of what is known through rational thought. In his incomplete Aesthetica, Baumgarten further defined the terms as follows: “Aesthetics (the theory of the liberal arts, the logic of the lower capacities of cognition [gnoseologia inferior], the art of thinking beautifully, the art of the analogon rationis) is the science of <strong>sensible cognition</strong>.” Since then, philosophers started exploring topics of:</p>
<ul>
<li>judgments of beauty: faculties of the judging subject and the qualities judged in the object</li>
<li>taste and preference</li>
<li>role of imagination</li>
<li>aesthetic and morality</li>
<li>experience of artwork</li>
</ul>
<p>only with the advent of <strong>cognitive science</strong> in the late 20th century that Baumgarten’s vision of aesthetics as a <em>science</em> of sensory cognition, including the study of our engagement with artworks, has become truly possible.</p>
<h2 id="the-viability-of-aesthetic-as-a-science">The Viability of Aesthetic as a Science</h2>
<ul>
<li>Logical Positivists: preferred to exclude anything that involves subjective feeling from the general domain of knowledge. Science could not, in principle, have any bearing on questions about the nature of art, beauty, or aesthetic appreciation.</li>
<li>analytic philosophers have been generally skeptical about the relevance of psychology to the philosophy of art and aesthetics.
<ul>
<li>Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Lectures in Aesthetics：</li>
<li>George Dickie’s “Is Psychology Relevant to Aesthetics”
<ul>
<li>when we answer aesthetic questions with data concerning the behavioral responses of participants to particular artworks we are committing a category mistake—we confuse a logical problem for a scientific one: what matters in the case of our responses to music is whether the formal composition of the work—in this case, the syntactic features of compositions that constitute a musical language is adequate for the attribution of the aesthetic feature in question. And this, Dickie argues, is a matter of convention rather than psychological causation—a matter of the rules of the particular language game appropriate to the production and appreciation of the category of music used as the stimulus. Questions about the nature of art and the character of aesthetic experience are prior logical questions about the use of a language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refute to Dickie’s arguments: recent imaging studies involving adjective matching and preference orderings support Dickie’s observations but challenge his assessment of the relevance of psychology to aesthetics: correlations among Calvo-Merino’ imaging results revealed common cortical networks subserving participants’ aesthetic judgments. Discussions of the functions of these cortical networks suggest that aesthetic judgments within a medium are realized by a unique set of psychological processes.
<ul>
<li>one can argue against Dickie that our use of aesthetic concepts in ordinary language draws on, reflects, or perhaps even itself constitutes an underlying tacit theory about the nature of art and the character of aesthetic experience; our systematic use of aesthetic terms in ordinary language should yield testable predictions about the nature of art and the character of aesthetic experience. Therefore, even if, as Dickie suggests, the philosopher of art is concerned with language games, a language game can be studied empirically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In below, the essay explores significant interactions between philosophy and psychology with special regard to the arts of literature, music, and visual art.</p>
<h2 id="literature">Literature</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jenefer Robinson’s Deeper than Reason: The Emotions and their Role in Literature, Music and Art.
<ul>
<li>James’s approach to the emotions: it is physiological change that is essential to an emotion. When we perceive something that causes fear, for example, that perception directly causes bodily changes.</li>
<li>judgmentalism: A judgment is an assertion and an assertion entails that we believe its propositional content. Therefore, the judmentalist holds that in order for an emotion to take hold, it is necessary that we have certain beliefs: an emotional state is essentially a judgment.</li>
<li>Robinson&rsquo;s rejection to the judgmentalism:
<ul>
<li>thought experiments (philosophically)
<ul>
<li>imagining cutting finger in half: emotion happens without belief</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>psychological
<ul>
<li>Zajonc has demonstrated that, at least in primitive episodes of emotional response such as the startle reaction, affect can obtain without being caused by any cognitive state</li>
<li>Zajonc and his colleagues have established that people form preferences for stimuli to which they had been previously exposed, but that were presented to them at rates too fast to allow conscious recognition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>neuroscience
<ul>
<li>Joseph LeDoux: &ldquo;Thinking, fast and slow&rdquo;: &ldquo;fast&rdquo; activates the amygdala directly, but then that system is checked by processes operating in the frontal cortex (&ldquo;slow&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the judgmentalist picture, the emotional state begins with a conscious <em>judgment</em>—an evaluation or appraisal of the stimuli: this causes a <em>feeling</em> state in me that puts me on the lookout for more relevant information and primes my <em>behavioral</em> response.</p>
<p>For Robinson, perception -&gt; physiological -&gt; behavioral -&gt; cognition kicks in at this point in the process, monitoring the earlier stages of the process and either endorsing them or modifying them. Robinson believes that changes in the facial musculature and the corresponding alterations of the autonomic nervous system provide some grounds for discriminating between the so-called basic emotions (e.g., anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise). However, she also maintains, as do the judgmentalists, that it is primarily the cognitive processing that attends the emotion that fixes the identity of the affective state.</p>
<p>However, some emotions look like they require a lot of cognition in the form of some antecedent deliberation. Absorbing literature emotionally seems more like the sort of affect that is born of reflection than like a non-cognitive reflex such as the startle response.</p>
<p>Reading a fiction prompts our memory system to recall event types like the ones in the story that provoke immediate, non-cognitive, affective appraisals, and thereby activate physiological changes and behavioral tendencies; this then is cognitively monitored, leading to an adjustment of our appraisal of the situation, refining our understanding of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>cognitively monitoring our emotional responses to literature can provide the foundation of our interpretive response</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt; Therefore, psychology is anything but irrelevant to the philosophy of art: it both contributes to our understanding of and enhances our capacity for narrative appreciation.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<ul>
<li>Plato&rsquo;s Republic: music in different modes affects our mental states in different ways
<ul>
<li>music is something we make direct physical contact with; the emotional and aesthetic effects of music are directly caused by the physical properties of musical sounds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eduard Hanslick’s The Beautiful in Music.
<ul>
<li>our affective responses to music could not involve genuine emotions, for an emotional response is not possible unless its object has some semantic content.
<ul>
<li>similar to judgementalist</li>
<li>in order for us to be saddened by music, the music would have to depict some particular thing that we recognize and react to in a canonical way. But music does not have the semantic resources of a language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similarly, Peter Kivy
<ul>
<li>The inability of music to express emotion literally is a conceptual claim for Kivy—it ultimately rests on our definition of the nature of emotion and the nature of music. Philosophers would do well to recognize that although questions about the nature of music or emotions may be partly conceptual questions, they are also <strong>empirical questions</strong>. Indeed, even where they are conceptual questions, our concepts continue to evolve as they are influenced by scientific developments.
<ul>
<li>the study of subject and object: perceptual psychology, the science of acoustics, affective neuroscience, cognition, emotion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="music-imagery">Music Imagery</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wittgenstein, Ryle, and Scruton: imagining is simply an attitude we take. Rather than believing that we hear a melody when there is no actual sound present, we merely imagine the sound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“imagination” is currently used to refer to any one of several related concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>imagination as the production of mental imagery</li>
<li>imagination as a faculty that organizes percepts for coherent cognition (the constructive imagination)
<ul>
<li>Kant argues that the imagination is responsible for shaping sensory information from perception so that it is available to our understanding, or coherent to us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>imagination in the sense of being imaginative or creative</li>
<li>imagination as a propositional attitude taken towards fictional or imaginary propositions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hume’s A Treatise of Human Nature: the imagination is a storehouse of ideas derived from past perceptions
=&gt; Cognition is a capacity that always needs the imagination, since it involves the comparison of present perceptions to past perceptions, or the application of general concepts, which are formed by the imagination. Having an image of something not present also involves the imagination, since this involves either the recall of a past idea from the imagination, or the construction of a new idea out of past ideas. To be imaginative in the sense of being creative, then, is to be especially innovative in constructing new ideas, whether these ideas are imagistic (i.e., sensory) or abstract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visual imagery has dominated mental imagery research in the late 20th century. These studies have demonstrated that imagery preserves key metrical properties of perceptual representations in a target modality, that it draws on the same neurophysiological processes as perception in a target modality, and that the capacity for imagery is disrupted by both focal damage and the application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the discrete brain regions that realize these perceptual processes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kosslyn, Ball, and Reiser: differences in the time it takes to answer questions about the presence of targets on a <em>memorized</em> map are proportional to the distances one would have to scan to locate them on the original.</li>
<li>Shepard and Metzler: differences in the time it takes for participants to evaluate whether an object is identical to a target in mental rotation studies are proportional to the distance the former would have to be rotated to match the latter.</li>
<li>imaging studies demonstrate that visual imagery tasks employ the same areas of the cerebral cortex that are involved in ordinary perception</li>
<li>Bisiach and Luzzatti: selective damage to one side of the cerebral cortex causes patients to fail to perceive objects in associated areas of the visual field, generalize to visual imagery.</li>
<li>Kosslyn and his colleagues have demonstrated that the use of rTMS to disrupt activity in areas of the cerebral cortex involved in the encoding of sensory information in visual experience also disrupts the capacity in normal perceivers to use imagery and visualization to make spatial comparisons among the parts of recollected visual stimuli</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auditory imagery experiments confirm that the metric properties (pitch, rhythm, and timbre) of auditory perception are preserved in auditory imagery: auditory imagery draws on the same neurophysiological processes in the auditory cortex as ordinary hearing, and that focal damage to these areas disrupts auditory imagery.</p>
<ul>
<li>Halpern: asked participants to identify whether a lyric was part of a song or not. Those asked to mentally play through the song took longer to respond than those who were not, and differences in their response times were proportional to the musical time between the target lyrics</li>
<li>In a second experiment, Halpern asked participants to identify whether a note corresponding to a lyric was higher or lower in pitch than the starting note. Some subjects could not do this at all. However, those with musical training were better than non-musicians, and differences in response times were more pronounced than in
the previous experiment.</li>
<li>the evidence seems to point towards a representation that
<ul>
<li>codes extension in time</li>
<li>unfolds in real time</li>
<li>has strong links between adjacent element</li>
<li>unidirectionally ordered</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall, these studies in psychology and neuroscience support the hypothesis that “parts of the cortex specialized for processing actual sound are also recruited to process imagined sound.” This, in turn, lends support for the phenomenological intuition that the experience of imagery is importantly like the experience of perception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auditory memories seem to be stored as past auditory percepts, and can be recalled in a way that reproduces the pitch and temporal details of the original auditory experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zatorre and Halpern review evidence that suggests that it is plausible to think that composers who report “hearing” their compositions internally are drawing on the same capacity for auditory imagery used to rehearse a remembered piece of music. Hearing a piece that one already knows involves reviving an auditory image of that piece, drawing upon memory stores that function as a kind of constructive imagination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>neural underpinnings of auditory imagery elucidates an important component of the musical listening experience</p>
<ul>
<li>musical capacities are highly variable: both listening to and performing music seems to alter the very structure of the brain - arguably, what is happening is the formation of <strong>aural/musical categories</strong> for the components of music as well as for entire compositions.
<ul>
<li>2 possibilities:
<ul>
<li>musical ability relevant to music listening can be developed later in life</li>
<li>there are limits to what listening capacities many people can develop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="visual-art">Visual art</h2>
<p>Cogintive Science: is the study of the way organisms acquire, recognize, manipulate, and use information in the production of behavior (the input and the output and their relationship): perceptual, affective, and cognitive</p>
<p>Current research in the cognitive neuroscience of visual art lies at the confluence of two broad research strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>empirical aesthetics: examine behavioral responses to artworks.</li>
<li>aesthetic experimentalism: the view that visual artists develop formal and compositional vocabularies by trial and error, or through a systematic exploration of the perceptual effects of different sets of marks, color schemes, and compositional arrangements. Therefore, we can learn about the operations of perceptual systems by examining the productive strategies of artists</li>
</ul>
<p>cognitive neuroscience of visual art rests on the assumption that correlations between the <strong>formal features of artworks</strong> and basic <strong>neurophysiological</strong> mechanisms in the visual system can be used to explain how visual artworks work as perceptual stimuli. A good deal of research in the cognitive neuroscience of visual art is dedicated to searching out and explaining these relationships between the formal strategies employed by artists and the operations of the visual system.</p>
<ul>
<li>visual system is a set of evolved biological mechanisms whose function is to select information from sensory inputs that is sufficient for visual recognition and action</li>
<li>The input to the visual system is replete with information about the local environment. However, only a small fraction of this information is diagnostic for the identity of an object, action, or event at any given time.</li>
<li>Artists’ formal methods and vocabularies are tools for selecting features sufficient for object, action, and event recognition from ordinary perceptual experience and rendering them in a medium</li>
</ul>
<p>Artworks can be thought of as artifacts intentionally designed to direct attention (perceptually sailent) to their artistically salient features (perceptual features responsible for the aesthetic effects and semantic associations)</p>
<h3 id="3-case-studies">3 case studies</h3>
<h4 id="georges-seurats-bathers-at-asnières">Georges Seurat’s Bathers at Asnières</h4>
<p>Georges Seurat used a formal technique called irradiation to enhance edges and amplify figure–ground segregation in Bathers at Asnières</p>
<ul>
<li>Irradiation is derived from the observation of Mach bands in ordinary perception, but has been used by painters long ago.
<ul>
<li>Mach band: Lateral inhibition helps boost the perception of object edges
<ul>
<li>A ganglion cell in the retina receives excitatory signals from photoreceptors and inhibitory signals from other ganglion cells that surround it. Ganglion cells along the bright side of the border between these regions receive less inhibition from their neighbors on the dark side. The overall response of these cells will therefore be higher than their neighbors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>one function of lateral inhibition is to amplify the intensity of a feature of the sensory input that defines the boundaries between objects in perception. This in turn contributes to form recognition by enhancing the contrast between figure and ground, thereby sharpening the perception of depth in the picture plane.</p>
<p>An artists’ formal vocabulary =&gt; its utility in paintings is explained by neurophysiological mechanisms in the visual system.</p>
<p>However, although this case study demonstrates that cognitive neuroscience can contribute to our understanding of the way paintings work as perceptual stimuli, it does not establish irradiated edges as <strong>artistically salient</strong> features of Bathers at Asnières, because Mach band is everywhere in the real life but we do not find all of them aesthetically pleasing =&gt; if the nature of art can be explained in terms of ordinary psychological processes subserving our engagement with artworks, one needs an additional explanation to determine what, if anything, differentiates artworks from ordinary artifacts.</p>
<h3 id="mona-lisa">Mona Lisa</h3>
<p>Sfumato is a formal technique in which artists blur the sharp edges that define object features in a painting. Leonardo used this technique to render the critical facial features that define Mona Lisa’s expression, the corners of her mouth and eyes. Gombrich argues that these sfumato contours introduce a degree of ambiguity into the painting that forces viewers to use their imagination to interpret an expression that cannot ever be discretely resolved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Livingstone has demonstrated that differences between the spatial resolution of peripheral and foveal vision explain how sfumato works to generate the dynamics of Mona Lisa’s expression
<ul>
<li>We are able to discern remarkably fine-grained visual detail in the central, or foveal, region of the visual field, but nearly blind to visual features defined by coarse-grained visual information; converse is true for peripheral vision. Livingstone reports that the spatial resolution of normal vision diminishes by a factor of 10 just 7 degrees from the central.
<ul>
<li>This difference in spatial resolution between central, or foveal, and peripheral vision is explained by the fact that the receptive fields of peripheral retinal neurons are dramatically larger than those of their foveal counterparts: foveal neurons are sensitive to sharp, narrow-luminance boundaries that carry high-spatial-frequency information, but are unable to register coarse, broad-luminance gradients, like contours rendered in sfumato, that carry low- and medium-spatial-frequency information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Smile is &ldquo;represented&rdquo; using sfumato in low and medium spatial frequencies: when one foveates on Mona Lisa’s smile it disappears; the smile reappears in a viewer’s peripheral field when he or she looks away.</p>
<p>Gombrich VS Livingstone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gombrich: a viewer’s interpretation of Mona Lisa’s expression should vary with his or her state of mind</li>
<li>Livingstone: he depicted expression varies systematically with the distance of one’s focus of attention from the center of Mona Lisa’s face</li>
</ul>
<p>However, similarly, it does not establish sfumatoed smile as <strong>artistically salient</strong> feature because of the same reason.
Nonetheless, Livingstone’s discussion contributes evidence in support of a particular hypothesis about the aesthetic quality of the painting.</p>
<p>Theories about the nature of art and aesthetic experience rest ultimately on their <strong>consistency</strong> with facts about the way we engage with particular artworks =&gt; vision science, or psychology in general can serve as constraints to help decide among competing theories.</p>
<h3 id="slave-market-with-the-disappearing-bust-of-voltaire">Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire</h3>
<p>Dalí’s painting is a bistable ambiguous image (like the duck/rabbit image). The bistability is an artistically salient feature of the painting that generates both the perceptual ambiguity and the range of semantic associations that are constitutive of its identity as an artwork.</p>
<p>Bonnar and her colleagues used a technique called <strong>frequency-specific</strong> adaptation to demonstrate that this high- and low-spatial-frequency information was selectively used to drive the perception of either the nuns or the bust of Voltaire in the painting.</p>
<ul>
<li>the nuns were more apparent in the high-spatial-frequency images and the bust of Voltaire was more apparent in the low-spatial-frequency images.</li>
<li>hypothesis: Frequency-specific adaptation can be used to desensitize the visual system to the particular spatial-frequency information presented in a stimulus. participants adapted to high-spatial-frequency information should see the bust of Voltaire and participants adapted to low-spatial-frequency information should see the two nuns.</li>
<li>Participants were primed with either high- (first group) or low-spatial-frequency (2nd group) dynamic noise. THe first group reported seeing Voltaire; the 2nd saw nuns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>We can come to understand the nature of art and aesthetic experience by tracking the relationship between the formal and compositional structure of particular artworks and viewers’ behavioral responses.</p>
<p>The model that emerges defines artworks as attentional strategies intentionally designed to direct attention and enhance the perception of features diagnostic for their artistically salient aesthetic (e.g., Mona Lisa’s elusive smile) and semantic (e.g., the bistable ambiguous content of Dalí’s painting) content.</p>
<p>These case studies each demonstrate a role for exogenous, stimulus-driven attentional processes in our engagement with artworks. However, attention is also <strong>endogenously</strong> driven by knowledge and expectations. Research suggests that artworks are attentional strategies that harness both basic formal features and viewers’ semantic knowledge, including art historical knowledge of the unique sets of formal strategies used to categorize artworks as belonging to artistic types (e.g., the works of particular artists, schools, or epochs), to convey their content.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>more work needs to be done to determine how to <strong>isolate and model</strong> the types of aesthetic and semantic effects used to categorize artifacts as artworks.</li>
<li>one needs a way to constrain our understanding of formal structure to just those features and relations that contribute to the function of an artifact as an artwork.
<ul>
<li>functional rather than descriptive</li>
<li>the functional sense provides a principled means not only to recover the content of the work without demanding explicit prior knowledge of an artist’s actual intentions, but also to evaluate the adequacy of competing interpretations of those intentions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The opening chapter of the book <em>Aesthetics of Science</em> by Arthur P.Shimamura
<ul>
<li>draws on ideas, identifies issues in aesthetics science from philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="problem-space-what-is-aesthetics">Problem Space: what is aesthetics</h2>
<ul>
<li>aesthetics when it was coined by Alexander Baumgarten: the study of how to mind beholds beautiful objects
<ul>
<li>aesthetic response/experience: feelings of beauty; certain physical properties of an object may evoke it, but the experience itself is purely subjective.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now: all kinds of <em>hedonic</em> response (a preference judgment) to a sensory experience
<ul>
<li>all kinds of emotion: beauty, anger, horror (emotion)</li>
<li>pique sensory processes (perception)</li>
<li>new idea, past experience (conception)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who: beholder&rsquo;s experience, not artist&rsquo;s. Highlight the ways in which art is perceived, interpreted (conceptual), and felt (emotional).</li>
<li>object of interest: art (some art may be anti-aesthetic), natural phenomena, objects not intended to be art</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="philosophical-4-approaches-that-highlights-different-aspects-of-human-psychological-experiences">Philosophical: 4 approaches that highlights different aspects of human psychological experiences</h2>
<h3 id="mimetic-an-imitation-of-the-real-world">Mimetic: an imitation of the real world</h3>
<p>Plato: art is at best a twice removal from the ideal world
Aristotle: art could rarify essential univerals
In paintings, artists create the illusion of objects in 3-D space on a 2-D surface , a feat that requires the knowledge of reverse-engineering the human vision.</p>
<ul>
<li>linear perspective and chiaroscuro</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="expressionist-express-and-induce-emotions">Expressionist: express and induce emotions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Francis Hutcheson: feelings of beauty and pleasure, independent of the object&rsquo;s purpose or function; subjective feelings but there are absolute standards.</li>
<li>David Hume: beauty is purely subjective (taste), because it is not in objects themselves. But there is universal standards on taste.</li>
<li>Kant: We interpret the world by linking sensory experience to pre-existing concepts or ideas (cognitive approach).
<ul>
<li>judgments of taste =&gt; decide what gives us pleasureable feelings</li>
<li>features of objects that are pleasureable: agreeable, good, and beautiful. Aesthetic judgements are judgments/evaluations of beautiful things</li>
<li>beauty: innate idea, a universal concept =&gt; Aesthetic judgments are both subjective (experience) and universal (innate, universal concept of beauty)</li>
<li>sublime: not a proeprty of an object, it is a feeling to be elicited.</li>
<li>aesthetic judgments are not associated with an object’s function or purpose: disinterested =&gt; art for art&rsquo;s sake, Romanticism</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="formalist-abstract-the-sensory-quality">Formalist: abstract the sensory quality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clement Greenberg about painting: 2-D is 2-D, not an illusion of 3-D. Impressionism.</li>
<li>Clive Bell: the essence of the aesthetic experience as per- ceiving significant <em>form</em>. The beholder considers an artwork purely on the basis of sensory features—that is, the aesthetic interplay of colors, lines, textures, and shapes: content and objects in a painting are irrelevant.</li>
<li>The advent of photographs moved artist away from mimetic and expressionist approaches to a formalist approach.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conceptual-convey-a-concept">Conceptual: convey a concept</h3>
<ul>
<li>prehistory art: convey a message, often to a higher being.</li>
<li>post-modernism: meta-art: try to explore the nature/meaning of art
<ul>
<li>ex: Duchamp&rsquo;s <em>Fountain</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>requires knowledge about the symbolic referents displayed in an artwork. To appreciate meta-art statements, it is necessary to have knowledge about art history and the various ways art has been defined.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summarization-of-philosophical-approaches">Summarization of Philosophical approaches</h3>
<p>Each of these approaches highlights different aspects of the beholder’s mental processes involved in the art experience: sensory processes with mimetic and formalist approaches, emotional processes with an expressionist approach, and semantic or cognitive processes with a conceptual approach.</p>
<h2 id="empirical-approaches-psychological-science">Empirical Approaches: Psychological Science</h2>
<h3 id="perception">Perception</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gustav Fechner, 1860: Psychophysics: the ways in which physical stimuli are registered by the mind.
<ul>
<li>Fechner, 1876: psychophysics of aesthetics. He suggested that aesthetics could be studied from the bottom up (elemental perceptual features): preference judgments for basic shapes, colors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gestalt psychology, early 20th century: perceptions could not be dissected into basic elements. It is the organization of a visual scene that we interpret and not the elemental features; the principle of Prägnanz, the notion that we organize our perceptions based on the simplest or most succinct interpretations.
<ul>
<li>Rudolf Arnheim applied Gestalt principles to the study of visual aesthetics. His Gestaltist interpretations stressed the manner in which the organization and dynamics of perceptual features act to create interest- ing works of art. He described paintings with respect to the “perceptual forces” that artists induced through balance, harmony, and object placement, anf these forces give rise to aesthetic experiences, such as a sense of calm or tenseness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="emotion">Emotion</h3>
<p>Daniel Berlyne:</p>
<ul>
<li>optimally pleasing artworks are those that create some arousal or psychological tension but not so much that they become disturbing.</li>
<li>arousal is determined by specific features of artworks, such as novelty, complexity, surprisingness, uncertainty, and incongruity: they must work together to produce emotion, the greater the nuumber of those features, the greater the arousal.
<ul>
<li>the features are not properties of the object, but related to the beholder’s past experience and knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>draws heavily on computer-based models of how the mind works.</li>
<li>information processing approach: the way sensory signals act as information that is encoded, interpreted, represented, and stored.
<ul>
<li>bottom up: from sensory signals to knowledge
<ul>
<li>Gustav Fechner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>top down: the use of knowledge to direct what we perceive (knowing is seeing, conceptual)
<ul>
<li>Ernst Gombrich
<ul>
<li>Based on our personal and cultural knowledge, the beholder forms expectations that help interpret an artwork and direct viewing to salient features</li>
<li>All art is illusory and we must build an interpretation of what an artwork represents based on existing knowledge (Schema): art as symbols</li>

<h2 id="empirical-approaches-neuroscience">Empirical Approaches: Neuroscience</h2>
<p>Neuroscientists have studied the workings of the brain from many levels of analysis—from analyses of individual brain cells (i.e., neurons) to the study of neural activity in the human brain. Both structural (anatomical) and functional (brain activity) analyses have been used to investigate the neural correlates of human cognitive function.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Prefrontal cortex (PFC): It receives inputs from other brain regions and sends projections back to these regions. In this way, the PFC coordinates and controls neural processing: top down processing</li>
<li>Korbinian Brodmann, 1909: defined 52 distinct areas in cerebral cortex on the basis of physical features, such as size, shape, and density (Brodmann areas).</li>
<li>Neuropsychological: the study of the relationship between behavior, emotion, and cognition on the one hand, and brain function on the other
<ul>
<li>observing the way damage to different parts of the brain disrupts cognitive function
<ul>
<li>case of Phineas Gage</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neuroimaging: fMRI: neuroscientists can assess brain activity in specific regions, virtually on a moment-to-moment basis
<ul>
<li>subtraction method: obtain scans from one condition and compare them to scans from another</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neuroaesthetics
<ul>
<li>Kawabata and ZekiL: Neural correlates of beauty: The orbitofrontal cortex was active when subjects were presented with paintings that they rated as beautiful compared to those rated as neutral.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="issues-for-aesthetic-science">Issues for Aesthetic Science</h2>
<p>Philosophical approaches offer guidelines for scientific investigations of aesthetics.</p>
<ul>
<li>mimetic, formalist: perceptual</li>
<li>expressionist: emotion</li>
<li>few empirical studies have addressed conceptual approaches to art, studying the role of knowledge in our art experience</li>
</ul>
<p>beholder: sensation, knowledge, and emotion (SKE)</p>
<p>artist: intention (I)
=&gt; I-SKE framework</p>
